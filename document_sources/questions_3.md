**Question:** What environmental or genetic factors contribute to the onset of reflex epilepsy?
**Answer:**

Would you like me to next produce **5 more covering rare epileptic syndromes** (e.g., Ohtahara, Dravet, West, Rasmussen, or Sturge-Weber)? Those are present in later parts of your file and provide high topical variety.

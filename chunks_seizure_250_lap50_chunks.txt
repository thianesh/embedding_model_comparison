<all-articles> <article> <slug>cannabidiol-oil</slug> <content>## What Is Cannabidiol? Cannabidiol (CBD) is a type of phytocannabinoid, which is a group of chemical compounds found in Cannabis plants (also called Marijuana or Hemp) that act on receptors in the brain and alter the release of neurotransmitters. There are around 113 phytocannabinoids identified in cannabis plants so far. It is being used for medical purposes in the form of hemp extract oil, capsules, dried cannabis, and liquid solution. These preparations have CBD as the active ingredient and it does not contain delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (D-9 THC). D-9 THC is the main psychoactive agent found in Cannabis plants, which causes altered sensory and time perception "the high." The cannabidiol drug Epidiolex was approved in the US in 2018 for the treatment of epilepsy disorders. All other CBD formulations are still illegal to prescribe for medical use except special epilepsy syndrome like Lennox Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome. ## What Is Cannabidiol (CBD) Oil? Cannabidiol (CBD) oil is extracted from the Cannabis plant and is said to have many therapeutic health benefits. It is believed to relieve symptoms commonly seen in anxiety, epilepsy, pain, spasticity, and cancer. CBD oil is extracted from industrial hemp, which contains a higher concentration of CBD than marijuana. CBD levels are affected by how the plant is breed. Different methods are used to extract this compound. This extract is added to a carrier oil, which makes it CBD oil. This oil comes in different strengths for various uses. Always consult your doctor

higher concentration of CBD than marijuana. CBD levels are affected by how the plant is breed. Different methods are used to extract this compound. This extract is added to a carrier oil, which makes it CBD oil. This oil comes in different strengths for various uses. Always consult your doctor before using it. CBD oils will not make you feel high, as they do not contain high amounts of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (D-9 THC). Everyone reacts to these oils differently, so it is best to try it yourself to see how effective it is. ## What Is the Difference Between CBD and THC? Cannabidiol (CBD) and Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are both found in marijuana, but they have very different effects. THC when inhaled or cooked with, makes a person high. It is a powerful psychoactive agent. CBD, on the other hand, is not a psychoactive agent, so it does not cause high. It is being used to manage the symptoms of many health conditions. ## How Does CBD Work? CBD attaches to certain receptors e.g. CB 1 and 2, 5 HT1 alpha, etc., and produces specific effects in the body. Some cannabinoids are produced by the human body itself, and the body has two main receptors called CB1 receptors and CB2 receptors for cannabinoids. CB1 receptors are majorly present in the brain, and some are present throughout the body. In the brain, these receptors help in coordination, movement, pain, mood, emotions, appetite, and memory. The agent THC attaches to these receptors. CB2

has two main receptors called CB1 receptors and CB2 receptors for cannabinoids. CB1 receptors are majorly present in the brain, and some are present throughout the body. In the brain, these receptors help in coordination, movement, pain, mood, emotions, appetite, and memory. The agent THC attaches to these receptors. CB2 receptors are commonly present in the immune system and affect pain and inflammation. It was believed that CBD attaches to these receptors, but now it has been agreed that it does not directly attach to the receptor. It is said to assist the body in using more of the naturally occurring cannabinoids. Other receptors are GPR55 antagonist has some anti-cancer effect, TPVR 1, and 5HT alpha and Adenosine A2A agonist produces anti-inflammatory effect and pain relieving effect. ## Can CBD Oil Make You High? An endocannabinoid system (ECS) is present in the human body, which receives and translates signals from cannabinoids. The body also produces some cannabinoids naturally called endocannabinoids. This ECS regulates functions like sleep, pain, and immune response. THC makes a person high when it enters the body, as it affects the brain's endocannabinoid receptors. This activates the pleasure center in the brain, which releases dopamine. CBD does not affect the brain but influences the body to use its endocannabinoids more effectively. Instead of affecting the ECS, it induces or blocks some compounds in this system. CBD helps in relieving pain by preventing the body from absorbing anandamide, which is a compound that regulates pain. This increases the

not affect the brain but influences the body to use its endocannabinoids more effectively. Instead of affecting the ECS, it induces or blocks some compounds in this system. CBD helps in relieving pain by preventing the body from absorbing anandamide, which is a compound that regulates pain. This increases the levels of anandamide in the bloodstream, which reduces pain. It also controls inflammation in the brain and nervous system. ## What Are the Health Benefits of CBD Oil? CBD is believed to help relieve symptoms in the following health conditions: * **Epilepsy (Seizure) Disorders** \- The CBD drug Epidiolex has shown to reduce seizures in adults and children. It is a prescription drug used for treating and reducing seizures seen in Dravet syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, Sturge-Weber syndrome, epileptic encephalopathy, and febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES). * **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)** \- A prescription nasal spray called Sativex is said to be effective in reducing pain, muscle tightness, and frequent urination in people with MS. It is only effective when CBD is combined with 9-delta-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). * **Painkiller and Anti-inflammatory Properties** \- CBD is believed to be a natural painkiller and anti-inflammatory agent. It was found to significantly reduce chronic inflammation and pain in test animals. These studies showed promising results for the use of CBD as a new treatment for chronic pain. * **Quitting Smoking** \- Some studies indicate that CBD may be used to help people quit smoking. It was found that smokers who inhaled smoke containing CBD, smoked

and pain in test animals. These studies showed promising results for the use of CBD as a new treatment for chronic pain. * **Quitting Smoking** \- Some studies indicate that CBD may be used to help people quit smoking. It was found that smokers who inhaled smoke containing CBD, smoked fewer cigarettes. It also controlled nicotine cravings. * **Drug Withdrawals** \- Some studies also showed promising treatment for people with Opioid, Morphine, and Heroin addictions. CBD helps reduce symptoms of drug withdrawal like anxiety, pain, insomnia, and mood swings. * **Cancer** \- It was found that CBD suppresses the growth of cancer cells and destroys them. There is some evidence that also prevents the spread of cancer. * **Anxiety Disorders** \- Generally, people with chronic anxiety are advised against using cannabis, as it can cause anxiousness and paranoia. But recent studies have shown to reduce anxiety in conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. * **Type 1 Diabetes** \- CBD might reduce inflammation in the pancreas, which might prevent or delay the onset of type 1 diabetes. * **Acne** \- Acne is caused by the overproduction of sebum by the sebaceous gland. CBD has found to lower sebum production and has an anti-inflammatory effect on the skin. * **Alzheimer's Disease** \- Initial studies found that CBD was able to prevent the development of social recognition deficits in Alzheimerâ€™s patients. These deficits make patients unable to recognize the faces of people they already know. CBD

These deficits make patients unable to recognize the faces of people they already know. CBD might also slow the progression of this disease. * **Parkinson's Disease** \- Taking CBD daily for 4 weeks showed to reduce the incidence of psychosis in Parkinsonâ€™s patients. * **Dystonia** \- Dystonia is a muscle disorder that results in involuntary muscle contractions. Taking CBD for 6 weeks helped improve dystonia in 20 to 50 % of patients. * **Insomnia** \- Some studies show that taking 160 mg of Cannabidiol before going to bed helps people with insomnia sleep better. * **GVHD (Graft-Versus-Host Disease)** \- It is a complication of bone marrow transplantation. Using CBD 7 days before and 30 days after bone marrow transplant increases the time it takes for GVHD to develop. * **Other Conditions** \- More studies are required to understand how CBD is helpful in conditions like bipolar disorder, Crohnâ€™s disease, type 2 diabetes, dystonia, Huntington's disease, Schizophrenia, etc. ## How to Choose the Right CBD Oil? Always go for a full-spectrum CBD oil, as it contains cannabinoids and other compounds present in the hemp plant. It might have more therapeutic effects than an isolate CBD oil. A full-spectrum CBD oil contains proteins, fatty acids, fiber, chlorophyll, flavonoids, and terpenes. Epidiolex is the only approved CBD drug,

A full-spectrum CBD oil contains proteins, fatty acids, fiber, chlorophyll, flavonoids, and terpenes. Epidiolex is the only approved CBD drug, which is used for epilepsy. Always consult your doctor before you try any CBD oil, as it might result in adverse side effects. ## Are CBD and Hempseed Oil the Same? No, they are not the same. CBD or hemp oil is made from the flower, bud, stems, and leaves of the Cannabis plant, and hempseed oil is made from hemp seeds. Hemp Seed oil is normally used as a topical skin product or a food additive. ## How Is CBD Oil Used? Always shake the bottle properly before use. Most drugs are kept under the tongue for 30 seconds to a few minutes before swallowing. For the proper dose, consult your doctor. It is best to start with a smaller dose, which can be increased after consulting your doctor. The dosage depends on the use, weight, metabolism, and body chemistry. You should not take consecutive doses before 4 to 6 hours. It can be taken at any time of the day. CBD usually starts acting within 30 to 90 minutes, but it might take several weeks to achieve long term effects. ## Is CBD Oil Safe? CBD oil is tolerated well in adults.

CBD oil is tolerated well in adults. It has no significant side effects on the central nervous system, vital signs, or mood. The common side effects include: * Tiredness. * Diarrhea. * Changes in appetite. * Liver problems. * Irritability. * Infections. * Rashes. * Reduced urination. * Breathing difficulties. ### Is CBD Legal? Currently, Epidiolex is the only approved CBD drug. Hemp and hemp-derived products are legal in the US if the THC content is less than 0.3 %. FDA has not approved the use of marijuana, but only approved a purified version of one CBD medication. More studies are required to understand the therapeutic and side effects of CBD oil. For more information, consult a doctor online. **Conclusion** While CBD is generally considered to be safe, it may have some adverse effects. They can include diarrhea, weight loss or weight gain, changes in appetite, and fatigue in some. In addition, it can interact with some medicines, causing harmful effects. Hence it is always important to start using or stopping any medicine with the advise of a healthcare expert. </content> </article> <article> <slug>geschwind-syndrome</slug> <content>**Introduction** Geschwind syndrome, also called Gastaut-Geschwind, consists of several behavioral phenomena seen in some individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy.

It was named after one of the first patients to categorize the symptoms, Norman Geschwind, who published detailed descriptions from 1973 to 1984. Whether Geschwind syndrome is a true neuropsychiatric disorder is debatable. This disorder leads to temporal lobe epilepsy and causes chronic, mild, interictal changes in personality, which gradually increase in intensity over time. In the field of neurology, this phenomenon has long captured the fascination of scientists and clinicians alike. It is a constellation of traits and behaviors. This syndrome encompasses a spectrum of peculiarities that manifest in certain individuals, offering a window into the intricate workings of the human brain. Read the article to learn about this disorder in detail. ## **What Is Geschwind Syndrome?** The Geschwind syndrome is a characteristic personality disorder consisting of circumstantiality (extreme verbal output and intense desire to draw or write), altered sexuality, and intensified mental life (extensive cognitive and emotional responses) observed in certain epilepsy patients. For easy identification, the term Geschwind syndrome has been assigned as a name for this group of behavioral phenomena. Support as well as criticism revolves around the existence of this syndrome as a specific personality disorder. The presence of an unsettled, ongoing controversy is still ongoing.

Geschwind syndrome has been assigned as a name for this group of behavioral phenomena. Support as well as criticism revolves around the existence of this syndrome as a specific personality disorder. The presence of an unsettled, ongoing controversy is still ongoing. Today, the strongest support comes from the various clinicians who have described and attempted to treat seizure patients with these personality features. Carefully directed studies are required to be conducted to confirm or deny that the Geschwind syndrome represents a specific epilepsy or psychiatric disorder. ## **When Did Geschwind Syndrome Originate?** Geschwind syndrome was first delineated by Norman Geschwind himself, a pioneering figure in the field of neurology, renowned for his contributions to understanding the complexities of the brain. In the early 20th century, Geschwind observed a pattern among individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy. These individuals exhibited a peculiar set of characteristics that seemed to coalesce around a central theme, thus laying the groundwork for what would later be recognized as Geschwind Syndrome. ## **What Are the Key Components of Geschwind Syndrome?** The Geschwind syndrome is characterized by five primary changes: * Hypergraphia (intense desire to write and draw). * Hyperreligiosity (a psychological condition where a person experiences intense religious beliefs that interfere with normal functioning). * Atypical (usually reduced) sexuality. * Circumstantiality (non-direct thinking that digresses from the main point of a conversation). * Intensified mental life. Not all of the above symptoms must be present for a diagnosis. Only certain individuals with epilepsy or temporal lobe epilepsy

religious beliefs that interfere with normal functioning). * Atypical (usually reduced) sexuality. * Circumstantiality (non-direct thinking that digresses from the main point of a conversation). * Intensified mental life. Not all of the above symptoms must be present for a diagnosis. Only certain individuals with epilepsy or temporal lobe epilepsy exhibit features of Geschwind syndrome. Let us delve into each component to unravel the intricacies of this syndrome: * **Hypergraphia:** Another hallmark of Geschwind Syndrome is hypergraphia, an insatiable compulsion to write. Affected individuals may produce an extraordinary volume of written material, ranging from elaborate essays to streams of consciousness. This outpouring of words serves as a means of expression, allowing them to channel their thoughts and emotions onto the written page with relentless fervor. * **Religiosity:** Individuals with Geschwind Syndrome often display an intense preoccupation with religious or spiritual matters. This fervor may manifest as a deep-seated devotion to religious practices, an obsession with religious texts, or an overwhelming sense of religious mysticism. This heightened religiosity can permeate every aspect of their lives, shaping their worldview and influencing their behavior. * **Atypical Sexuality:** Individuals with Geschwind syndrome reported a higher rate of atypical or altered sexuality. In around half of affected individuals, hyposexuality has been documented. Less commonly, cases of hypersexuality have been reported. * **Circumstantiality:** People with this syndrome exhibit non-direct thinking that digresses from the main point of a conversation. An individual who shows this characteristic involves insignificant information that distracts from the central theme or important

of affected individuals, hyposexuality has been documented. Less commonly, cases of hypersexuality have been reported. * **Circumstantiality:** People with this syndrome exhibit non-direct thinking that digresses from the main point of a conversation. An individual who shows this characteristic involves insignificant information that distracts from the central theme or important point of a conversation. The overthinking of this extraneous information might make it problematic to follow the speakerâ€™s thought process or arrive at a meaningful conclusion to a question. Deriving information in clinical set-up from circumstantial patients can be demanding and time-consuming. * **Intensified Mental Life:** Individuals with Geschwind Syndrome possess a profound inclination toward philosophical or existential contemplation. They may grapple with profound questions about the nature of existence, the meaning of life, and the mysteries of the universe. This philosophical introspection can border on obsession, driving them to explore profound existential themes with unparalleled intensity. ## **What Is the Cause Behind Geschwind Syndrome?** While the clinical features of Geschwind Syndrome are adequately documented, the underlying neurological mechanisms are still a topic of ongoing investigation. It is believed globally that the temporal lobe, especially the dominant hemisphere, plays a vital role in shaping the expression of this syndrome. Disturbances in the intricate neural networks within the temporal lobe might lead to alterations in cognition, emotion, and behavior, giving rise to the characteristic features of Geschwind Syndrome. Moreover, the interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors may contribute to the development and expression of Geschwind Syndrome. Certain genetic variations associated

in the intricate neural networks within the temporal lobe might lead to alterations in cognition, emotion, and behavior, giving rise to the characteristic features of Geschwind Syndrome. Moreover, the interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors may contribute to the development and expression of Geschwind Syndrome. Certain genetic variations associated with neuronal excitability and connectivity can predispose patients to this syndrome, while environmental influences such as early-life stress or trauma may exacerbate its manifestations. ## **How to Manage Geschwind Syndrome?** Geschwind Syndrome poses distinctive challenges in clinical setup, as its diverse array of symptoms can usually resemble features of other psychiatric or neurological conditions. Misdiagnosis is common, and a comprehensive diagnosis is essential to identify the underlying etiology. Treatment strategies for Geschwind syndrome often focus on symptomatic treatment and improving quality of life. Pharmacological interventions might be employed to reduce symptoms like anxiety or mood disturbances, while psychotherapy can help individuals navigate the existential complexities associated with the syndrome. **Conclusion** Despite decades of research, Geschwind syndrome remains a tantalizing enigma; its origins shrouded in mystery, its manifestations as diverse as the individuals it affects. As the understanding of the human brain continues to evolve, so too do the insights into this intriguing syndrome. Perhaps one day, the intricacies of Geschwind syndrome will be unraveled, shedding light on the profound mysteries of the mind. Until then, it remains a captivating puzzle, beckoning neuroscientists and clinicians alike to delve deeper into its depths. </content> </article> <article> <slug>lennox-gastaut-syndrome</slug> <content>## What Is Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome?

Epilepsy is a central nervous system disorder. In the brain, epilepsy creates brief yet strong electrical bursts. Epilepsy can take the form of Lennox- Gastaut syndrome (LGS). Children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), also known as childhood epileptic encephalopathy, have numerous seizure types, mental regression or retardation, and abnormal electroencephalography results showing a specific pattern of brain activity known as slow spike-and-wave. The recurring seizures (epilepsy) start early in life. ## What Are the Typical Features Seen in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome? Tonic seizures, which lead to involuntary muscle contraction, are the most prevalent type of seizure. These seizures frequently happen while one is sleeping, but they can sometimes happen when the individual is awake and result in unexpected falls. Atypical absence seizures, which result in a momentary loss of consciousness, are also frequent. Numerous affected people also experience episodes known as "drop attacks," which result in unexpected falls and serious or life-threatening injuries. Drop attacks can be brought on by either an aberrant muscle contraction (tonic) or a sudden lack of muscle tone (atonic). Less frequently reported seizures in those with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome include other forms. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome-related seizures frequently do not respond well to anti-epileptic drug therapy. Even while the duration

injuries. Drop attacks can be brought on by either an aberrant muscle contraction (tonic) or a sudden lack of muscle tone (atonic). Less frequently reported seizures in those with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome include other forms. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome-related seizures frequently do not respond well to anti-epileptic drug therapy. Even while the duration of each Lennox-Gastaut syndrome-related seizure event is often brief, more than two-thirds of those who are affected have extended periods of seizure activity (also known as status epilepticus) or bouts of several seizures that happen in a cluster. Even before their first seizure, the majority of kids with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome have intellectual impairments or learning issues. If seizures are severe or frequently occurring, these issues may get worse with time. Some affected youngsters can experience behavioral issues and various neurological impairments. Many people also have delays in the development of motor abilities like sitting and crawling. Most persons with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome need assistance with daily activities due to their seizures and intellectual disabilities. Only a small portion of affected adults live on their own. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome patients are more likely to pass away than others their own age. The increased risk is partially brought on by poorly controlled seizures and injuries from falls. ## What Causes Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome? The cause of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is not always known by doctors. In some instances, it might be brought on by: * Oxygen deficiency during labor. * Severe brain damage associated with pregnancy or childbirth, such as those caused by low birth weight

injuries from falls. ## What Causes Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome? The cause of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is not always known by doctors. In some instances, it might be brought on by: * Oxygen deficiency during labor. * Severe brain damage associated with pregnancy or childbirth, such as those caused by low birth weight or early delivery. * Brain infections such as encephalitis, rubella, or meningitis. * Infantile spasms, or West's syndrome, are infantile seizures that first appear in children. * Cortical dysplasia is a condition where some brain nerve fibers do not align properly as the unborn child develops. * With tuberous sclerosis, the brain and other organs throughout the body can develop non-cancerous tumors. * Genetics. ## What Are the Symptoms of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome? Depending on the kind of seizure the patient is having, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome symptoms can change. Among the signs of a tonic seizure are: * Stiffness in the trunk, legs, or arms. * Seizure affects both sides of the body. * Patients can fall. Atonic seizure symptoms include: * Abrupt decline in muscle tone. * Falling to the ground and becoming limp with a momentary loss of consciousness. * Sagging eyelids. * Nodding of the head. * Jerking. Symptoms of an atypical absence seizure include: * Muscle wasting in the head, abdomen, arms, or legs frequently causes a sagging posture over time. * Myoclonic (slight) jerking movements. * Loss of consciousness. The following can be signs of myoclonic seizures: * Muscle spasms that can be: * Sudden. * Brief.

of an atypical absence seizure include: * Muscle wasting in the head, abdomen, arms, or legs frequently causes a sagging posture over time. * Myoclonic (slight) jerking movements. * Loss of consciousness. The following can be signs of myoclonic seizures: * Muscle spasms that can be: * Sudden. * Brief. * Involuntary. * Shock-like. * Varying in frequency and intensity. * Affects either the entire body or just a specific area of it. * Sometimes it is severe enough to make it difficult to move, speak, or eat. Patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome frequently experience some degree of behavioral or mental difficulties. This might comprise: * Delays in development. * Disruptions in behavior. * Comprehending information with difficulty. ## How to Diagnose Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome? A diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome requires the identification of a clinical trio. A peculiar electroencephalography brain wave pattern (slow spike-and-wave pattern) and several seizures of various sorts make up this triad, Although this pattern may not be present in every electroencephalography and some degree of behavioral and cognitive problems. A precise diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is challenging due to the possibility that some of these symptoms may not be present at the disorder's inception. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome has a wide range of probable causes, which further complicates the diagnosis. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is often diagnosed after a careful clinical examination, full patient history review, and comprehensive physical and neurological examination, which may include the use of cutting-edge imaging methods like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). * Electroencephalography

a wide range of probable causes, which further complicates the diagnosis. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is often diagnosed after a careful clinical examination, full patient history review, and comprehensive physical and neurological examination, which may include the use of cutting-edge imaging methods like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). * Electroencephalography records the electrical activity of the brain. Such EEG testing often identifies the specific brain wave pattern in people with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. * A three-dimensional image of the brain's anatomy is created during an MRI scan, which enables medical professionals to evaluate the brain's structure and maybe identify the source of seizure activity. * Multiple genetic causes of epilepsy are being tested using epilepsy gene panels, which are beginning to be used in evaluation procedures. ## How Is Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome Treated? Treatment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome can be quite challenging. In order to enhance seizure control and other related problems, a combination of seizure drugs and other treatments may be employed. * The drug Valproate is used as the first-line treatment for diverse seizure types. Clobazam, Lamotrigine, Topiramate, Cannabidiol, and Rufinamide are some more anticonvulsant drugs. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Cannabidiol in June 2018 for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome seizures in people two years of age and older. The substance lacks the euphoria that is typically associated with marijuana and only includes trace amounts of the psychoactive component. * The ketogenic diet, vagus nerve stimulation, and epilepsy surgery are further treatment options. In epilepsy surgery,

treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome seizures in people two years of age and older. The substance lacks the euphoria that is typically associated with marijuana and only includes trace amounts of the psychoactive component. * The ketogenic diet, vagus nerve stimulation, and epilepsy surgery are further treatment options. In epilepsy surgery, typically a corpus callosotomy, deep in the brain, a band of nerve fibers known as the corpus callosum joins the two hemispheres of the brain together and it facilitates communication between the two hemispheres of the brain, but it also aids in the propagation of seizure impulses from one side to the other. The corpus callosum is sliced during a corpus callosotomy procedure, which stops the spread of seizures. In order to maximize seizure control, medication may be taken with the other treatments. Children who initially make progress can eventually develop a medication tolerance or experience uncontrollable seizures. **Conclusion:** Children and adults with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, as well as those who care for them, continue to face many difficulties. In order to find improved cures of all kinds, a lot more study is required. Families, medical professionals, and researchers need to give new developments in seizure detection, recording, and alerting, as well as other precautions and safety equipment, more consideration. For people with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and their carers, these kinds of therapies and services can enhance the quality of life and safety management. </content> </article> <article> <slug>temporal-lobe-seizures</slug> <content>**Introduction:** Temporal lobe seizures, a subset of epileptic disorders, cast a profound shadow over

Characterized by recurrent, unpredictable episodes of abnormal electrical activity within the brain's temporal lobes, these seizures can have far-reaching consequences on cognitive, emotional, and physical well-being. In this complex neurological realm, understanding the cardinal features, diagnostic approaches, and management strategies for temporal lobe epilepsy becomes paramount, ultimately shedding light on improved patient care and a better quality of life. ## What Is a Temporal Lobe Seizure? Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most prevalent form of partial seizure disorder in adults and often necessitates surgical treatment for those with treatment-resistant epilepsy. TLE patients can be suitable candidates for surgical intervention, particularly when they have a surgically addressable epileptic condition. TLE can be categorized into two types based on the location of the epileptic focus: 1. **Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE):** This involves the innermost structures of the temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala. It is the most common type of temporal lobe seizure and is frequently associated with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). 2. **Lateral Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (LTLE):** The neocortical temporal lobe, LTLE is rare and typically linked to genetic factors or acquired structural and anatomical abnormalities. Temporal lobe epilepsy encompasses a range

amygdala. It is the most common type of temporal lobe seizure and is frequently associated with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). 2. **Lateral Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (LTLE):** The neocortical temporal lobe, LTLE is rare and typically linked to genetic factors or acquired structural and anatomical abnormalities. Temporal lobe epilepsy encompasses a range of conditions characterized by seizures originating in the temporal lobe. These conditions have diverse underlying causes, including tumors, vascular irregularities, cortical dysplasia, tubers, traumatic injuries, and hippocampal sclerosis. Each of these pathologies likely has a distinct pathologic mechanism linked to the specific nature of the abnormality. Moreover, the functional anatomy of the seizures generated by these pathologies will differ depending on the location of the abnormality within the temporal lobe. ## What Are the Clinical Features of Temporal Lobe Seizures? The clinical features of temporal lobe seizures: **Prodrome:** * Some patients experience warning signs before a seizure that can last minutes to days, including headaches, personality changes, irritability, or anxiety. Often, these signs are noticed by others rather than the patient. **Aura:** * Auras are actually simple partial seizures and often precede complex partial seizures (CPS) that last from seconds to a couple of minutes. * The type of aura may relate to where the seizure originates in the temporal lobe. These include sensory sensations like stomach sensations, experiential phenomena (feelings of fear), and hallucinations (gustatory and olfactory). **Altered Consciousness:** * Complex partial seizures involve altered consciousness, typically characterized by behavioral arrest and staring that lasts for 30 seconds to

may relate to where the seizure originates in the temporal lobe. These include sensory sensations like stomach sensations, experiential phenomena (feelings of fear), and hallucinations (gustatory and olfactory). **Altered Consciousness:** * Complex partial seizures involve altered consciousness, typically characterized by behavioral arrest and staring that lasts for 30 seconds to a couple of minutes. * It is important to distinguish impaired awareness from temporary communication or comprehension difficulties while maintaining conscious awareness. **Amnesia:** * Individuals with seizures may not be aware they had a seizure and may not remember events before the seizure. * The extent of memory loss varies, often resulting from bilateral impairment of hippocampal function. **Automatisms:** * Automatisms are involuntary motor activities that occur alongside altered consciousness during seizures that can be spontaneous or preservative. * Common automatisms involve actions like fumbling, lip-smacking, or chewing. * Less common ones include vocalizations, unusual behaviors (crying or laughing), and even leaving behaviors (running during a seizure). **Types of Temporal Lobe Seizures:** * Temporal lobe seizures can be simple partial, complex partial, or secondarily generalized. * Specific features of these seizures provide insights into the origin and localization within the temporal lobe. ## How Are Temporal Lobe Seizures Assessed? Neuroimaging and EEG play crucial roles in evaluating individuals suspected of having temporal lobe epilepsy. Since seizures are intermittent and infrequent for most epilepsy patients, conducting diagnostic assessments between seizures is essential. **EEG (Electroencephalography):** * EEG should be performed for all suspected temporal lobe epilepsy cases. * It helps pinpoint the

Since seizures are intermittent and infrequent for most epilepsy patients, conducting diagnostic assessments between seizures is essential. **EEG (Electroencephalography):** * EEG should be performed for all suspected temporal lobe epilepsy cases. * It helps pinpoint the location of the epileptic networks. * A diagnostic ictal EEG recording typically shows a rhythmic five to seven-hertz theta-wave frequency with peak recordings in sphenoidal and basal temporal electrodes on the same side as the epileptic focus. * Interictal EEG may reveal spike-and-wave or sharp and slow complexes, often in the anterior temporal region. * Differentiating between mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (LTLE) through EEG can be challenging as the waveforms are similar. * In cases of normal initial EEG results, sleep deprivation, and video EEG telemetry may aid in diagnosis, intracranial electrodes could be considered if there is discordance between scalp EEG and other clinical data. **Neuroimaging:** * Neuroimaging is crucial to identify structural anomalies causing temporal lobe seizures, such as vascular malformations, tumors, and hippocampal sclerosis. * Computed tomography (CT) scans are commonly used but have limited sensitivity compared to MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), which is the preferred method. * MRI is vital for pre-surgical assessment, with hippocampal sclerosis being a common finding. * MRI can reveal reduced hippocampal volume and increased signal intensity on T2 imaging. * T1 imaging provides detailed neuroanatomical information. * Approximately 57 percent of epileptogenic lesions are missed

Limited evidence supports its effectiveness compared to the WADA test. ## What Is the Treatment and Management of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy? Treatment and management of temporal lobe epilepsy are crucial for improving a patientâ€™s quality of life and reducing the cumulative time spent in seizures, which can lead to neurocognitive decline. This includes **Pharmacological Interventions:** * Initial management upon diagnosis usually involves antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). * Older AEDs like Phenytoin, Valproate, Carbamazepine, and Phenobarbital are equally effective as newer AEDs but may have more adverse effects. * Women of childbearing should consider the potential teratogenicity of AEDs in the first trimester. * About one-third of patients may not achieve seizure resolution with AEDs. **Refractory Epilepsy:** * For individuals who do not respond to AEDs, a definition of refractory epilepsy is based on various factors, including seizure frequency, severity, the number of AED failures, adverse effects, and impact on daily life. * Surgical options may be considered for refractory cases, providing up to an 80 percent remission rate, especially in cases of hippocampal sclerosis. **Surgical Interventions:** * Two common surgical procedures are anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) and selective amygdalohippocampectomy (AHP). * A meta-analysis shows no significant difference in one-year seizure freedom between ATL and AHP but a significant improvement compared to AEDs. * ATL techniques involve the anterior temporal lobe, while AHP focuses on preserving lateral temporal lobe function. * Less invasive approaches, such as stereotactic radiosurgery and laser ablation, are considered for challenging

However, if one cannot access the take-back program, they can discard the drug by following FDA protocols and guidelines for safe drug disposal. **For Doctors:** **Clinical Pharmacology** **Mechanism of Action** The mechanism by which Lacosamide exerts antiepileptic effects in humans remains to be fully elucidated. The drug also binds to CRMP-2 (collapsin response mediator protein-2), a phosphoprotein primarily expressed in the nervous system and involved in controlling axonal outgrowth and neuronal differentiation. However, the role of CRMP-2 binding is unknown in seizure control. **Pharmacodynamics** A pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (efficacy) analysis was performed based on the pooled data from the three efficacy trials for partial-onset seizures. Drug exposure is correlated with a reduction in seizure frequency. However, drug dosages above 400 mg/day (milligrams per day) do not grant any additional benefit in group analyses. **Pharmacokinetics** * **Absorptionâ€”** Following oral administration, the drug is completely absorbed in the negligible first-pass effect, showing an absolute bioavailability of about 100 percent. The extent and rate of absorption do not affect the drug. The maximum serum concentration is reached at the end of the infusion following intravenous or into-the-vein (IV) administration. An infusion of 30 to 60 minutes is bioequivalent to tablets (oral). * **Distribution -** The drug's distribution volume is 0.6 liters per

and rate of absorption do not affect the drug. The maximum serum concentration is reached at the end of the infusion following intravenous or into-the-vein (IV) administration. An infusion of 30 to 60 minutes is bioequivalent to tablets (oral). * **Distribution -** The drug's distribution volume is 0.6 liters per kilogram (L/kg), and it is less than 15 percent bound to plasma protein. * **Metabolism -** The drug gets metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 to form O-desmethyl lacosamide, an inactive metabolite in humans. There is no enantiomeric interconversion of the drug. * **Elimination -** The drug gets excreted from the systemic circulation by biotransformation or renal excretion. Following oral and intravenous administration of approximately 100 mg (milligrams) of radiolabeled drug, around 95 percent of the radioactivity was found in the urine and less than 0.5 percent in the feces. The major part of the excreted compounds, approximately 40 percent of the dose, were unchanged Lacosamide, and around 30 percent was its O-desmethyl metabolite. Almost 20 percent was a structurally unknown polar fraction. **Ingredients:** **Active Ingredients: Lacosamide.** Inactive Ingredients: Crospovidone, colloidal silicon dioxide, hydroxypropyl cellulose, Lecithin, hypromellose, low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, polyvinyl alcohol, and titanium dioxide. **Contraindications** None. **Warning and Precautions** * **Suicidal Behavior and Ideation** AEDs or antiepileptic drugs, such as Lacosamide, are known to increase the risk of suicidal behavior or thoughts in patients using these medications for any indication. Therefore, a person treated with such drugs for any

polyvinyl alcohol, and titanium dioxide. **Contraindications** None. **Warning and Precautions** * **Suicidal Behavior and Ideation** AEDs or antiepileptic drugs, such as Lacosamide, are known to increase the risk of suicidal behavior or thoughts in patients using these medications for any indication. Therefore, a person treated with such drugs for any condition should be carefully monitored. * **Cardiac Rhythm and Conduction Abnormalities** * **Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Flutter -** Lacosamide in adult patients with partial-onset seizures showed no cases of atrial fibrillation or flutter during clinical studies. The drug is not recommended in elderly patients with diabetic neuropathy. The drug administration may predispose to atrial fibrillation or flutter (atrial arrhythmias), especially in patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetic neuropathy. * **PR interval Prolongation, Atrioventricular Block, and Ventricular Tachyarrhythmia -** Lacosamide should be cautiously used in patients with underlying cardiac conduction problems, including marked first-degree AV (atrioventricular) block, second-degree, or higher AV block, severe cardiac disease, such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure, or structural heart disease, and cardiac sodium channelopathies (Brugada Syndrome). Also, the drug should be cautiously used with medications, such as beta-blockers, sodium channel blockers, calcium channel blockers, potassium channel blockers, and drugs that prolong the PR interval. In such cases, it is recommended that the patient obtain the ECG (electrocardiogram) before starting Lacosamide and after the drug is titrated to the steady-state maintenance dose. Additionally, the patients administered an intravenous dosage of Lacosamide should be closely monitored. * **Dizziness and Ataxia** The drug may cause ataxia and dizziness

Chunk 49:
such cases, it is recommended that the patient obtain the ECG (electrocardiogram) before starting Lacosamide and after the drug is titrated to the steady-state maintenance dose. Additionally, the patients administered an intravenous dosage of Lacosamide should be closely monitored. * **Dizziness and Ataxia** The drug may cause ataxia and dizziness in adult and pediatric patients. The onset of these two conditions was most commonly noticed during titration. Therefore, it is recommended to administer the clinically indicated loading dose under medical supervision because of the possibility of increased incidence of adverse reactions, including central nervous system-related adverse reactions, such as dizziness and ataxia. * **Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs** Lacosamide, like any other antiepileptic drug, should be withdrawn slowly, over a minimum of one week, to minimize the potential for increased seizure frequency in patients with seizure disorders. * **Syncope** There was no increase in syncope compared to placebo during the short-term controlled trials of Lacosamide in adult patients with partial-onset seizures with no significant system conditions. Also, the cause of syncope was not determined in most cases. However, in some cases, changes in orthostatic blood pressure, bradycardia, atrial flutter, or fibrillation (and associated tachycardia) were observed in patients receiving doses above 400 milligrams per day. * **Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria** Lacosamide oral solution contains aspartame, a source of phenylalanine, which is harmful for patients suffering from phenylketonuria. Thus, before prescribing the drugâ€™s oral solution to such patients, the doctor must consider the combined daily amount of Phenylalanine from all sources,

400 milligrams per day. * **Risks in Patients with Phenylketonuria** Lacosamide oral solution contains aspartame, a source of phenylalanine, which is harmful for patients suffering from phenylketonuria. Thus, before prescribing the drugâ€™s oral solution to such patients, the doctor must consider the combined daily amount of Phenylalanine from all sources, including the drug itself. * **Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multi-Organ Hypersensitivity** DRESS, also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity, has previously been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, such as Lacosamide. The events have also been fatal or life-threatening in some cases. The condition is often characterized by rash, fever, lymphadenopathy, or facial swelling in association with other organ system involvement, such as nephritis, hepatitis, hematologic abnormalities, myositis, myocarditis, or sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Therefore, in such cases, the patient must be cautiously evaluated, and Lacosamide should be discontinued if any other cause cannot be established for the signs or symptoms. **Drug Interactions:** Some serious drug reactions occur with the following drugs: * Abametapir. * Fexinidazole. * Ivosidenib. * Tucatinib. * Apalutamide. * Idelalisib. * Metoclopramide intranasal. * Voxelotor. Uses in Specific Populations **Pregnancy** It is recommended to maintain a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in females exposed to antiepileptic drugs, such as Lacosamide, during pregnancy. The background risk of miscarriage and major birth defects for this population group is not known. However, all pregnancies carry a risk of birth loss, defect, or other adverse outcomes. Also, during animal studies, the drug has shown birth

in females exposed to antiepileptic drugs, such as Lacosamide, during pregnancy. The background risk of miscarriage and major birth defects for this population group is not known. However, all pregnancies carry a risk of birth loss, defect, or other adverse outcomes. Also, during animal studies, the drug has shown birth defects, neurobehavioral changes, and decreased brain weight in the juvenile and neonatal phases. Therefore, the drug should be cautiously prescribed to this population group only after evaluating the potential risks and benefits of the drug to the pregnant women and the fetus. **Breastfeeding** The drug gets excreted in human milk and is also known to cause sleepiness in breastfed infants due to Lacosamide exposure. The effects of the drug on milk production are not known clearly. Therefore, the drug must be cautiously prescribed to breastfeeding females. Also, the health and developmental effects of the fetus, along with the drugâ€™s need for the mother, and the adverse effects of the drug on the fetus and mother, must be cautiously evaluated. **Pediatric Use** The safety and effectiveness of the drug in the pediatric population of less than one month of age is not yet established. However, the drug is safe to be used in children of one month of age and older. **Geriatric Use** The safety and effectiveness of the drug is not known in this population. However, dose titration should be done cautiously, usually starting at the lower end of the dosing range. **Hepatic Impairment** For pediatric and adult patients with

used in children of one month of age and older. **Geriatric Use** The safety and effectiveness of the drug is not known in this population. However, dose titration should be done cautiously, usually starting at the lower end of the dosing range. **Hepatic Impairment** For pediatric and adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, an approximately 25 percent reduction of the maximum dosage is recommended. Close observation, dose initiation, and titration are advised for mild to moderate cases. The drug is not recommended for severe cases. **Renal Impairment** Dose adjustment is not needed in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. However, in patients with severe renal impairment and those with end-stage renal disease, a reduction of 25 percent of the maximum dosage is recommended. </content> </article> <article> <slug>occipital-epilepsy-and-visual-phenomena</slug> <content>**Introduction** Epilepsy is a persistent neurological illness that results in seizures due to aberrant electrical activity in the brain. Occipital epilepsy is distinguished by visible symptoms (hallucinations or visual field abnormalities). Individual features of duration, color, form, size, position, movement, pace of growth, and advancement make clinical identification of visual seizures simple. They differ significantly from migraine visual aura, although they frequently cause migrainous Headaches, most likely by activating trigeminovascular or brain stem pathways.

The progression to temporal lobe structures differs from and is consistent with symptomatic occipital lobe epilepsy. Continue reading to learn more, including its origins, symptoms, and treatment options. ## What Is the Cause of Occipital Epilepsy? * Occipital epilepsy is occipital seizures caused by an epileptic focus in the occipital lobes. Based on their clinical appearance, these epilepsies are divided into two types. * Autonomic symptoms characterize children with Panayiotopoulos syndrome (PS), whereas visual symptoms characterize children with idiopathic childhood occipital epilepsy of Gastaut (ICOE-G). * A tiny proportion of people with this disease cannot be classified into one of these two groups. * The cause of benign occipital seizures is thought to be hereditary. * While no genetic aberration has been found, the genetic basis is believed to be complicated and polygenic. * The lateral supra calcarine region is the source of sensory and motor complaints. * Complex posture results from medial supra calcarine spread. ## What Is the Occurrence of Occipital Epilepsy? Occipital epilepsy accounts for between five and ten percent of all epilepsies. These uncommon disorders have a shallow occurrence; nevertheless, the precise incidence is unknown. The prevalence in published demographic research is six percent, close to the five percent documented in the neurosurgical series. Occipital seizures were found in one percent of newly diagnosed epilepsy cases in population research. However, this study recognized the possibility of underdiagnosis

shallow occurrence; nevertheless, the precise incidence is unknown. The prevalence in published demographic research is six percent, close to the five percent documented in the neurosurgical series. Occipital seizures were found in one percent of newly diagnosed epilepsy cases in population research. However, this study recognized the possibility of underdiagnosis because occipital epilepsies might mirror other epilepsy syndromes and be mistaken. Seizures frequently migrate from the occipital area to the brain's more anterior regions. In fifty percent of neurosurgery series, infra calcarine occipital foci migrated to the ipsilateral medial temporal lobe. ## What Is Occipital Epilepsy and Visual Phenomena? * Transient visual symptoms, which can be positive (flashes, phosphenes) or negative (amaurosis, hemianopia, scotoma), define visual subjective symptoms. * Positive visual hallucinations often manifest unilaterally in the temporal visual field, opposite to the epileptogenic center. * Between ten and thirty percent of the time, they appear in the center or an ambiguous place. * Depending on the trajectory after their first display, they might multiply, grow in size, or alter their placements and luminance. * The three main types of motion are rotation, translation on a two-dimensional plane, and flickering or flashing. They often have a circular shape and are multicolored. * Other shapes are uncommon, but if the occipitotemporal cortex is involved, they grow more complex. * Heautoscopy is a rare condition in which the patient may view their picture. * Simple visual hallucinations can develop into more severe forms after spreading to different areas. * There are also

multicolored. * Other shapes are uncommon, but if the occipitotemporal cortex is involved, they grow more complex. * Heautoscopy is a rare condition in which the patient may view their picture. * Simple visual hallucinations can develop into more severe forms after spreading to different areas. * There are also perceptual illusions when an object appears to be distorted. Simple perceptual illusions include distortions in illumination, color, clarity, shape (metamorphopsia), size (macropsia, micropsia), and shape (metamorphopsia). * Macroproxiopia and microtelepsia, as well as teleopsia, are examples of complex illusions where objects appear disoriented in the distance. * Alternatively, the patient may have permanent or recurrent palinopsia and diminished or improved stereoscopic vision. Palinopsia, sensory hallucinations of ocular movements, or blindness can also occur in individuals. Visual hallucinations may make an appearance first, followed by ictal blindness. On occasion, it might be the only sign. Ictal hemianopia (occurs less commonly) and ictal blindness (occurs in thirty-three percent of symptomatic and 67 percent of idiopathic occipital epilepsy patients, respectively) are both common. * In nearly fifty percent of cases, headaches that resemble migraines manifest themselves. Blindness may occur with severe seizures or status epilepticus. ## What Is the Significance of Occipital Epilepsy? Visual hallucinations, ictal blindness, orbital discomfort, headache, nausea, and vomiting are all possible symptoms. Patients may experience localized sensory or motor complaints when problems move beyond the occipital lobe. Seizures are common in certain youngsters and might occur regularly if not treated. Transient visual symptoms that might be favorable (flashes,

Visual hallucinations, ictal blindness, orbital discomfort, headache, nausea, and vomiting are all possible symptoms. Patients may experience localized sensory or motor complaints when problems move beyond the occipital lobe. Seizures are common in certain youngsters and might occur regularly if not treated. Transient visual symptoms that might be favorable (flashes, phosphenes) or negative (amaurosis, hemianopia, scotoma) characterize visible subjective symptoms. Positive visual hallucinations most commonly manifest unilaterally in the temporal visual field contralateral to the epileptogenic center. They appear centrally or in an unknown place between ten and thirty of the time. Depending on the development, they may increase, grow in size, or change places and brightness after their first appearance. Flickering or flashing is widespread, translation in a two-dimensional plane is less common, and rotation or movement towards or away from the camera is uncommon. They are often multicolored and round. Other forms are uncommon, but they grow more complicated when the occipitotemporal cortex is involved. ## How Is the Occipital Epilepsy Diagnosed? Temporal scalp EEG commonly exhibits aberrant findings with distinguishing features particular to underlying causes. Around the board, posterior temporal activity is the most frequent observation. Bilateral frontally predominate paroxysms and widely dispersed diffuse posterior sharp or spike activity are additional observations. An EEG may capture bilateral epileptiform discharges from each occipital lobe. The discharges with lower voltage indicate secondary spread. It is crucial to remember that EEG results could not reveal the occipital origin of the seizure but rather the spread to the frontal, parietal, and

spike activity are additional observations. An EEG may capture bilateral epileptiform discharges from each occipital lobe. The discharges with lower voltage indicate secondary spread. It is crucial to remember that EEG results could not reveal the occipital origin of the seizure but rather the spread to the frontal, parietal, and posterior temporal regions. Children may experience quick dissemination of the seizure to the opposing occipital lobe, but adults may see delayed findings. Structural abnormalities may be found via neuroimaging. ## How Is Occipital Epilepsy Treated? * Depending on the cause and severity of occipital epilepsy, medical or surgical treatment may be utilized. * The anti-seizure drugs carbamazepine, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate are advised. * Children with idiopathic occipital epilepsies are most frequently treated with carbamazepine, which has a 90 percent clinical success rate. * Children with idiopathic photosensitive occipital epilepsy may benefit from sodium valproate. * Surgery is increasingly being considered for those with medically intractable occipital epilepsy, with total long-term seizure remission occurring in 65 percent of cases. A visual field deficiency is the most frequent problem. * Since fewer patients than expected had post-surgical visual field abnormalities, there are theories that some patients have cortical reorganization. * Before surgery, neuroimaging techniques like ictal Spectroscopy and ictal positron emission tomography (PET) may be used to confirm the resection area. * Although it has been utilized to preserve visual integrity during intraoperative mapping using electrocortical stimulation while awake, it is currently not routinely practiced. **Conclusion** Occipital epilepsy is distinguished

In a temporal hemifield, supplementary visual hallucinations mainly comprised colorful and tiny circular patterns flashing or multiplying. It was uncommon to see flashing lights or non-circular patterns. Visible seizures were often common, occurring in many clusters daily or monthly. They often appeared alone, although they frequently progressed to additional occipital and extra-occipital ictal symptoms. Misdiagnosis of visual seizures as migraine aura was widespread. The use of medicine, surgery, and technology can achieve control. Many people have had success in reducing or eliminating seizures. </content> </article> <article> <slug>focal-epilepsy</slug> <content>**Introduction** Seizures are a condition that occurs due to abrupt and uninformed electrical activity that occurs in the brain. Focal seizures occur when electrical activity occurs in a limited brain area. Most of the time, seizures occur due to electrical activity in one hemisphere of the brain; in rare cases, they can be caused in both hemispheres involving the whole brain, called generalized seizures. A focal seizure is less severe compared to a generalized seizure. ## What Is Meant by Focal Epilepsy?

both hemispheres involving the whole brain, called generalized seizures. A focal seizure is less severe compared to a generalized seizure. ## What Is Meant by Focal Epilepsy? Focal epilepsy usually occurs in specific brain regions and is less intense as the person does not lose consciousness. This condition is also known as auras. The signs and symptoms of a focal seizure depend on the region of the brain from where they occur; these may be: * **Motor:** When a focal seizure occurs due to electrical activity in the motor region, it affects the muscle activity resulting in jerk movement of the arm and foot. The doctors can find which side of the brain is affected by seeing the side of the affected body. * **Sensory:** When the sensory part of the brain causes a seizure, it affects the senses, like hearing, olfactory (smell), and other senses. * **Autonomic:** A focal seizure associated with the brain's autonomic region affects involuntary functions like blood pressure, heart rhythm, and other parts. * **Psychic:** When this brain region is affected, it triggers emotions and previous memories, causing fear and anxiety. ## Who Does Focal Seizure Affect? Anyone can experience seizures, which can be caused more frequently in people with some head injury, birth abnormalities of the brain, stroke, febrile seizure, tumors, and others. The most prevalent form of seizure is the focal seizure. ## What Are the Types of Focal Seizures? There are three types of focal seizures: * **Focal Aware Seizure:** It is

more frequently in people with some head injury, birth abnormalities of the brain, stroke, febrile seizure, tumors, and others. The most prevalent form of seizure is the focal seizure. ## What Are the Types of Focal Seizures? There are three types of focal seizures: * **Focal Aware Seizure:** It is also called a simple focal or partial seizure. This seizure has a specific feature where the person will know when the seizure occurs. * **Focal Impaired Awareness Seizure:** This is the most common form of focal seizure, called a complex seizure, experienced by almost 36 % of the population. This destroys the consciousness of the person. If the aura is formed, it occurs before any disruption to the awareness. * **Bilateral Tonic-Clonic Seizure:** This condition is distinguished by full-body involvement and convulsive episodes. ## What Is the Cause of Focal Seizure? * Brain tumors, including cancer tumors. * Lack of oxygen. * Arrhythmias, which is irregular heart rhythm. * Aneurysms, bulging, and weakening of the blood vessels result in swelling of vessels. * TBI (traumatic brain injury). * Withdrawal symptoms of alcohol and drug. * Reduced levels of calcium, magnesium, and sodium. * High fever may result in febrile seizures in children. * Genetic conditions and hormone-related issues. * High or low blood sugar. * Response of the immune system against infection. * Stroke. * Usage of drugs. ## What Are the Warning Signs of Focal Seizure?

in children. * Genetic conditions and hormone-related issues. * High or low blood sugar. * Response of the immune system against infection. * Stroke. * Usage of drugs. ## What Are the Warning Signs of Focal Seizure? Most of the common warning signs that every person can experience is an aura. Aura can occur just before an episode of seizure when a person is very well aware, and the person can experience many signs and symptoms. ## How Is Focal Seizure Diagnosed? Doctors usually diagnose seizures based on the signs and symptoms experienced by the person. With various diagnostic methods, it can be ruled out whether the seizure was provoked or non-provoked. Genetic tests can also rule out the cause of the seizure. Identifying the brain region where the seizure started can help extensively diagnose and treat any form of focal seizure. Some diagnosing tests are: * Blood test helps rule out any genetic cause or immune system issue. * EEG, an electroencephalogram, is used to record brain activity. * MEG, magnetoencephalography, records the magnetic field produced by the brain's electric activity. * PET, positron emission tomography, is used to monitor physiological function. * MRI, magnetic resonance imaging, creates images using a magnetic field and a computer. * Lumber puncture, where a liquid sample is taken from the vertebrae. ## How Is Focal Seizure Managed?

using a magnetic field and a computer. * Lumber puncture, where a liquid sample is taken from the vertebrae. ## How Is Focal Seizure Managed? The treatment of focal seizure depends on whether the seizure caused is provoked or unprovoked. In case of a provoked seizure, treating the underlying cause can help prevent the occurrence of a seizure. If the underlying cause is not treatable, then managing the seizure through medication and another method can help reduce the severity and frequency of occurrence of focal seizures. When an unprovoked seizure occurs, no treatment is required if the chance of recurrence is less. If the risk of unprovoked seizure is high, then treatment is needed. Treatment of focal seizure is provided through, * **Medication:** Some intravenous medications can help reduce the severity of the seizure as they occur; other medicines are in the form of pills, which need to be taken regularly. * **Diet Alteration:** A low or no-carb diet can help reduce the frequency of focal seizures. * **Surgery:** Removing the brain region which is responsible for the occurrence of seizures can help. * **VNS (Vagal Nerve Stimulation):** The frequency of seizures can be reduced by stimulating the vagus nerve, which is directly connected to the brain. * **DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation):** During this procedure, a device is surgically implanted into the individual's body, establishing a connection with the brain. This device provides a mild electrical signal that interferes with the brain's electrical signals and prevents seizure occurrence. Usually, a

which is directly connected to the brain. * **DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation):** During this procedure, a device is surgically implanted into the individual's body, establishing a connection with the brain. This device provides a mild electrical signal that interferes with the brain's electrical signals and prevents seizure occurrence. Usually, a focal seizure occurs briefly, lasting for a few seconds to minutes. It usually occurs for about one to two minutes. It may only happen for a short duration in some people. Post effect of focal seizure varies from person to person. Some people may feel fine, but some may feel weak after an episode of seizure. Some may feel confused, and others may be unable to move their body, called Todd's paresis, which may last a few minutes. ## What Is the Outlook of Focal Seizure? Focal seizure is not dangerous, but if it causes tonic-clonic seizure or if it occurs more often, then they should be treated. The outlook of focal seizure depends on the severity, underlying cause, and the medication taken. In most cases, education and surgery can help. **Conclusion** Focal seizure is a less severe and common seizure that is caused due to the electric activity of the brain in a particular region. These seizures can be provoked or unprovoked. It may very rarely result in a generalized seizure. This condition can be treated by treating the underlying cause. In case of unprovoked seizures, medication and surgery can help. Many affected people can live with minimal effects

The disorder known as West's syndrome is categorized as epileptic encephalopathy. Epileptic encephalopathies are diseases that cause children to experience seizures in addition to cognitive and developmental delays. Infantile spasms may be related to a developmental regression as well as a highly irregular pattern of electrical activity in the brain called hypsarrhythmia. Infantile spasms are a special form of seizure that begins in the first one to two years of life. Both spasms and hypsarrhythmia have been shown to have an indirect influence on cognitive and behavioral deficits. ## What Are the Causes of Westâ€™s Syndrome? * Alterations to the patient's DNA. * Metabolic diseases. * Extraordinary brain structure or development. * Oxygen deprivation leads to brain damage. * Brain trauma. * Infection of the brain abnormalities, including hemimegalencephaly (a rare neurological disorder characterized by abnormal brain development) and cortical dysplasia (a developmental abnormality that affects the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain). * Chromosomal anomalies, including Down syndrome. * Neurocutaneous illnesses, including tuberous sclerosis complex-(TSC) (a genetic disorder characterized by the formation of benign tumors in various organs of the body.), Sturge Weber syndrome

The disease typically manifests as epileptic seizures during the initial three months of a kid's growth), as well as a mutation of the ARX gene or CDKL5 gene on the X chromosome. ## What Is the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex's (TSC) Effect on the Syndrome? The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is the condition that causes West syndrome in the vast majority of patients.

of a kid's growth), as well as a mutation of the ARX gene or CDKL5 gene on the X chromosome. ## What Is the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex's (TSC) Effect on the Syndrome? The tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is the condition that causes West syndrome in the vast majority of patients. TSC is a genetic disorder that is inherited from generation to generation in an autosomal dominant manner and is associated with epileptic seizures, malignancies of the eye, heart, and kidneys, and skin abnormalities. There are two types of genetic disorders: dominant and recessive. A dominant genetic condition is one in which only one copy of a gene that does not function properly is required to cause the disease. The inactive gene may have been passed down from either of the affected individual's parents, or it may be the product of a mutant gene that occurred in the affected person themselves. There is a 50 percent chance that an affected parent will pass on a gene that is dysfunctional to the child. ## What Are the Signs and Symptoms? Signs of West syndrome typically manifest during the first year of life. The typical age at which epileptic spasms begin is six months. The conditions listed below are symptoms of West syndrome. * **Involuntary Muscle Spasms -** There are electrical abnormalities in the brain known as seizures. Typically, each involuntary spasm begins abruptly and lasts only a few seconds, and they frequently occur in clusters lasting ten to 20 minutes. It is

months. The conditions listed below are symptoms of West syndrome. * **Involuntary Muscle Spasms -** There are electrical abnormalities in the brain known as seizures. Typically, each involuntary spasm begins abruptly and lasts only a few seconds, and they frequently occur in clusters lasting ten to 20 minutes. It is characterized by quick, uncontrollable contractions of the head, neck, and trunk and/or uncontrolled extension of the legs and/or arms; they may occur upon awakening or after feeding. Seizures differ in duration, intensity, and affected muscle groups among infants. * **Psychomotor Retardation -** The majority of youngsters will have regression or delay in the acquisition of abilities requiring coordination of muscles and voluntary movements. * **Recurrent Epileptic Seizures -** The recurring occurrence of seizures is the hallmark of the brain condition epilepsy. A seizure is typically characterized as an abrupt change in behavior caused by a transient disturbance within the neuronal activity of the brain. * **Lennox-Gastaut syndrome -** It is characterized by difficult-to-control seizures of varying forms and intellectual incapacity. ## What Is the Diagnostic Method for Westâ€™s Syndrome? The diagnosis of the condition is made through monitoring and characterization of the patterns of brain activity using various instruments, such as: **1\. Electroencephalography (EEG):** Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non- invasive and painless method of measuring the electrical activity patterns of the brain. The presence of a pattern known as hypsarrhythmia in a patient, particularly when the individual is sleeping, can be suggestive of epileptic spasms. On occasion, a patient diagnosed

as: **1\. Electroencephalography (EEG):** Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non- invasive and painless method of measuring the electrical activity patterns of the brain. The presence of a pattern known as hypsarrhythmia in a patient, particularly when the individual is sleeping, can be suggestive of epileptic spasms. On occasion, a patient diagnosed with epileptic spasms will not display the hypsarrhythmia pattern on an electroencephalogram (EEG) because of a delay between the onset of clinical symptoms and the appearance of the pattern. An assessment for epileptic spasms could be supported by the results of a long-term video EEG. **2\. Brain Imaging Techniques, which include** * **Computed Tomography (CT):** The images of the brain are generated, from which the development's finer points can be assessed. CT is also effective at revealing regions of calcification, which, in particular instances, may be crucial to the diagnosis. * **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** Using the magnetic characteristics of certain atoms found in the brain, this radiological approach generates comprehensive images of brain cross-sections or slices. The images are more detailed than a CT scan and can provide information on any deformities of the brain's structures or other sorts of lesions that are typically observed in epileptic spasms. * **Molecular Genetic Testing:** Molecular genetic testing refers to the diagnostic process that involves the analysis of an individual's genetic material at the molecular level. Numerous genetic panels can assess children of a certain age for a range of epilepsy-related inherited illnesses, such as spasms. * **Other Tests:** Tests on the

**Molecular Genetic Testing:** Molecular genetic testing refers to the diagnostic process that involves the analysis of an individual's genetic material at the molecular level. Numerous genetic panels can assess children of a certain age for a range of epilepsy-related inherited illnesses, such as spasms. * **Other Tests:** Tests on the patient's blood, urine, and lumbar puncture can help determine the likelihood of infection being the underlying cause of the epileptic spasms. **3\. Woodâ€™s Lamp Examination:** For determining that tuberous sclerosis is a viable diagnosis, a Wood's lamp is used to inspect the skin for pigment-free lesions. ## What Are the Treatment Methods? Infantile spasms have been treated with ACTH, oral corticosteroids, Vigabatrin, and standard antiepileptic medications (AEDs). The medicine of choice for patients with tuberous sclerosis or symptomatic infantile spasms was Vigabatrin. * **Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH):** Adrenocorticotropic hormone steroid medication induces a cessation of spasms and improves the EEG in patients within a few weeks. It is administered as a daily intramuscular injection. Irritability, hypertension, infection, brain atrophy, hypertension, metabolic abnormalities, osteoporosis, sepsis, and congestive heart failure are typical side effects of this medication. * **Vigabatrin (VGB):** In situations of West syndrome, the anticonvulsant drug has a high effectiveness rate. It functions by increasing the level of the neurotransmitter GABA in the central nervous system. VGB is usually well for children, with the majority of adverse effects being mild. Included are headache, vertigo, weariness, weight gain, and decreased muscle tone. Permanent retinal toxicity, which causes visual field constriction but no

It functions by increasing the level of the neurotransmitter GABA in the central nervous system. VGB is usually well for children, with the majority of adverse effects being mild. Included are headache, vertigo, weariness, weight gain, and decreased muscle tone. Permanent retinal toxicity, which causes visual field constriction but no discernible alteration to central vision, is a potentially serious adverse effect. * **Second-Line Therapy:** These medicines include corticosteroids, anti-seizure drugs, Pyridoxine, intravenous immunoglobulin, surgical removal of the seizure-producing regions of the brain, and a ketogenic diet, which is a specific, extremely high-fat diet widely being used to manage numerous kinds of epilepsy. * **Surgery:** Cortical excision is the process of eliminating the aberrant portion of cortical tissue. The purpose of this is either to reduce the frequency of seizures or to enhance brain growth. Patients who are: * Not responding to ACTH and/or Vigabatrin. * Display structural brain defects in a specific area. **Conclusion** Infantile spasms are a type of epileptic encephalopathy that can be difficult to treat and frequently result in the child's inability to function normally. Genetic testing and MRI scans of the brain, both of which are easily accessible, can produce the best results in terms of diagnosing the origin of the condition. The diagnosis of the underlying cause is important since it affects both the therapy recommendations and the prognosis. In most cases, a period of two weeks is sufficient to determine whether the first-line therapy, such as a hormone treatment or another prescription, is beneficial

diagnosing the origin of the condition. The diagnosis of the underlying cause is important since it affects both the therapy recommendations and the prognosis. In most cases, a period of two weeks is sufficient to determine whether the first-line therapy, such as a hormone treatment or another prescription, is beneficial to the patient. A methodical strategy for treatment is linked to an increase in the utilization of first-line treatments as well as an improvement in spasm cessation rates at three-month follow-ups. The treatment's goal would be to bring about a complete and total absence of infantile spasms. Those who are diagnosed in a timely manner and given treatment that is both adequate and appropriate, particularly those who have idiopathic infantile spasms, have the greatest possibility of achieving a normal or near-normal outcome. </content> </article> <article> <slug>epilepsy-and-exercise</slug> <content>**Introduction** Physical activity is extensively covered as a supplementary treatment to reduce seizure susceptibility and improve the quality of life in people with epilepsy. People with epilepsy can participate in a particular activity. It is essential to take into account the type of sport, the type and severity of the seizures, seizure precipitating factors, the typical timing of seizure occurrence, and the person's attitude toward accepting some level of risk. As a non-pharmacological method, exercise or athletic involvement can be combined with regular epilepsy therapy. ## What Is Epilepsy?

toward accepting some level of risk. As a non-pharmacological method, exercise or athletic involvement can be combined with regular epilepsy therapy. ## What Is Epilepsy? The neurological condition of epilepsy is characterized by abnormal brain activity that results in seizures or episodes of strange behavior, feelings, and even loss of consciousness. This can develop due to a genetic condition or a traumatic brain injury or stroke; the triggering factors include missed medicine, lack of sleep, stress, alcohol, alcohol consumption, prolonged fasting, physical overtiredness, and menstruation. However, stress-induced seizures are easily avoided through sports and exercise. ## What Causes Epilepsy During Exercise? Exercise-induced seizures occur during running, stationary cycling, or playing collective sports activities. The triggering or precipitant factors related to exercise are hyperthermia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypoxia, hyperventilation, fatigue, and stress from the competition. * **Hyperthermia:** Rarely, long-term exercise-induced hyperthermia (fever) is accompanied by a decrease in cerebral blood flow. Fever is the most frequent cause of seizures in children and infants; hence it has been postulated that prolonged activity in highly humid and hot settings puts a person with epilepsy in danger of hyperthermia. Additionally, utilizing blood glucose and oxygen also decreases the blood histamine level. * **Hypoglycemia:** Seizures may be triggered by prolonged exercise-induced hypoglycemia. Decreased glucose levels in epilepsy patients might change neural or brain function. People with type one diabetes mellitus occasionally experience hypoglycemia seizures. * **Hyponatremia:** Homeostasis of the electrolytes is essential for proper brain function, and any imbalance can result in seizures. Exercise-associated hyponatremia is

be triggered by prolonged exercise-induced hypoglycemia. Decreased glucose levels in epilepsy patients might change neural or brain function. People with type one diabetes mellitus occasionally experience hypoglycemia seizures. * **Hyponatremia:** Homeostasis of the electrolytes is essential for proper brain function, and any imbalance can result in seizures. Exercise-associated hyponatremia is characterized by low blood sodium levels that occur during or after physical activity, followed by a hemodilution. It is considered the leading risk factor for hyponatremia. * **Hypoxia:** Hypoxia is not evident in exercise; it can happen during high-altitude sports like skiing or rock climbing. Stimulating peripheral chemoreceptors in hypoxia causes hyperventilation, which results in respiratory alkalosis and may ultimately cause seizures. * **Hyperventilation:** Hypoxia reduces cerebral blood flow and hyperventilation (a reduction in arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure). However, increased ventilation during exercise or sports is a physiological demand in response to respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. * **Fatigue:** Physical and emotional exhaustion can result from sports or physical activity. For example, football or soccer induce more stress on the brain than other sports activities. * **Stress:** It is a common precipitating factor of epilepsy. The mental focus during competitive sports has a higher risk of inducing seizures. ## What Is the Relationship Between Epilepsy and Exercise? Everyone benefits from exercise, but those with epilepsy also greatly benefit from it. Epilepsy is triggered by stress, which can be easily avoided through sports and exercise.

What Is the Relationship Between Epilepsy and Exercise? Everyone benefits from exercise, but those with epilepsy also greatly benefit from it. Epilepsy is triggered by stress, which can be easily avoided through sports and exercise. Rarely, physical activity can cause seizures. Practice doesn't make epilepsy worse, but it can help seizure management by enhancing general health. The majority of sports are safe for people with epilepsy to play. There is no evidence that even contact sports may cause seizures. If seizures are well-controlled and a direct supervisor is present, participating in water activities is likewise safe. Only the sports requiring heights require extra attention or care, such as horseback riding and several forms of gymnastics, such as parallel bars and uneven bars. It is best to avoid overexertion, dehydration, and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), as these conditions might raise the possibility of having a seizure. ## What Is the Role of Exercise in Reducing Comorbidities From Epilepsy? Epilepsy is linked to a higher risk of psychiatric and medical comorbidities. Depression and anxiety are frequent co-morbidities that can affect the quality of life. Epilepsy, recurring episodes of seizures, using anticonvulsant drugs, or a combination of these variables may lead to mental abnormalities. The exercise decreases stress, thereby reducing seizure vulnerability and, as a result, a drop in epilepsy comorbidities. Additionally, some anticonvulsant drugs might lead to obesity and reduced bone density, but regular exercise can minimize these harmful effects and improves bone stability. ## What Is Exercise's Role in Managing the

abnormalities. The exercise decreases stress, thereby reducing seizure vulnerability and, as a result, a drop in epilepsy comorbidities. Additionally, some anticonvulsant drugs might lead to obesity and reduced bone density, but regular exercise can minimize these harmful effects and improves bone stability. ## What Is Exercise's Role in Managing the Adverse Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs? The core of epilepsy therapy is antiepileptic medicine, although some of the side effects may have an impact on athletic performance. Avoid using anabolic steroids (synthetic artificial versions of testosterone) since they may have long-term adverse effects and may affect the blood levels of antiepileptic drugs. In addition, seizures have been linked to the use of anabolic steroids by some individuals. The common side effects are * Fatigue. * Tiredness. * Poor concentration. * Altered the balance and coordination. * Obesity. * Blurred vision. * Decreased bone density. Sports and physical activity can help to avoid or offset some antiepileptic drug adverse effects, such as weight gain or increased bone fragility. ## What Are the Safety Guidelines for Exercise to Avoid Epilepsy? General safety considerations may include the following * Stay aware of epilepsy-triggering factors and avoid those activities. * Stay away from exercise when physically or mentally overtired. * Stay well-hydrated by drinking plenty of water. * Have some food before working out. * Get good sleep before engaging in any physical activity. * Be aware of your limitations and avoid over-practicing. * Inform both a teammate and a coach about the medical condition.

Even though the sports medicine doctor may not always be able to treat many of these illnesses effectively, he or she should be knowledgeable about the best diagnostic techniques and current therapeutic alternatives. Making judgments on return to play require this information, which is crucial for properly participating in treatment decisions. Exercise has been utilized successfully as an additional type of epilepsy therapy. Exercise knowledge might improve the quality of life for people with epilepsy.

Corpus callosotomy (CC) is a surgical procedure that is used to treat epilepsy. Epilepsy is a chronic condition marked by recurring seizures. The corpus callosum is a bundle of nerve fibers that helps the brain's hemispheres communicate with one another and is severed by the neurosurgeon during this treatment. The procedure tries to reduce epilepsy (a disorder of the brain that causes seizures) symptoms by interfering with the hemispheres' ability to transmit seizure signals. This procedure, also known as split-brain surgery or callosal sectioning, lessens the effects of seizures ( unregulated electrical activity of the brain) in both adults and children. Though it does not completely stop seizures, it can lessen their frequency and intensity, providing a possible course of treatment for people with refractory epilepsy. ## What Are the Indications of CC? * When a person with epilepsy still experiences seizures after taking a variety of anti-seizure drugs, surgery may be an option. For seizures referred to as drop attacks (abrupt falls, with or without unconsciousness, caused by abnormal leg muscular contractions or a breakdown of postural muscle tone), a particular procedure known as a corpus callosotomy (CC) is beneficial. * Seizures of different kinds, such as atonic (sudden

may be an option. For seizures referred to as drop attacks (abrupt falls, with or without unconsciousness, caused by abnormal leg muscular contractions or a breakdown of postural muscle tone), a particular procedure known as a corpus callosotomy (CC) is beneficial. * Seizures of different kinds, such as atonic (sudden loss of strength and tone in the muscles), tonic (the legs, arms, or trunk muscles suddenly stiffen or tense), spasms (involuntary, forceful contraction of a muscle that prevents it from relaxing results), and myoclonic (sudden, uncontrolled muscular spasms), are included in these episodes. Occasionally, the person may fall and injure their forehead or face. Depending on how severe their seizures are, CC may be an option even for immobile individuals who do not have drop attacks. * Other seizure types can also benefit from this surgery. Before prescribing CC, doctors frequently search for particular patterns in the brain's electrical activity, such as synchronized or independent spikes. ## What Are the Treatment Options and Success Rates for Children Undergoing Corpus Callosotomy to Manage Seizures? Children who get corpus callosotomy see a significant decrease in seizure frequency and intensity in 80 percent of the cases. The child's physician will offer information about the procedure's likelihood of success specific to the child. Although there is always the option to keep taking medication to control seizures, the effectiveness of these treatments tends to wane with each new medication trial, providing little opportunity for sustained seizure control.

the procedure's likelihood of success specific to the child. Although there is always the option to keep taking medication to control seizures, the effectiveness of these treatments tends to wane with each new medication trial, providing little opportunity for sustained seizure control. The medical team will consult with the parents or caregivers to examine the appropriateness of alternative treatments, such as the ketogenic diet or vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy. ## How Is CC Performed? General anesthesia is used during a corpus callosotomy to guarantee the patient's unconsciousness. A craniotomy (the brain is exposed after removing the skull) is started by the neurosurgeon by excising a section of the skull and carefully removing the dura, which is the outer membrane that surrounds the brain. The corpus callosum is then meticulously sliced using specialist instruments under surgical microscopes. The dura (outer layer of the skull) is then restored, and staples or stitches are used to reposition the skull bone. In some instances, the process is done in two steps. The first step involves the front portion of the corpus callosum, which permits the brain's various regions to continue exchanging visual information. A second procedure to sever the corpus callosum may be considered if the patient continues to experience severe, ongoing seizures. ## What Are the Surgical Compilations of CC? * **Hydrocephalus and Subdural Fluid Collection -** Subdural fluid accumulation (cerebrospinal fluid collection between the outer lining of the brain, also known as the dura mater, and the brainâ€™s surface) may happen

considered if the patient continues to experience severe, ongoing seizures. ## What Are the Surgical Compilations of CC? * **Hydrocephalus and Subdural Fluid Collection -** Subdural fluid accumulation (cerebrospinal fluid collection between the outer lining of the brain, also known as the dura mater, and the brainâ€™s surface) may happen following CC, particularly in events of brain shrinkage. Usually, there are no symptoms associated with this. However, when the lateral ventricle opens during the callosal section, it may result in hydrocephalus, a neurological condition caused by an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain's deep ventricles or cavities. The ventricles expand due to this extra fluid, damaging the brain's tissue. To minimize the possibility of hydrocephalus and fluid accumulation, surgeons attempt to prevent opening the lateral ventricle. If it happens accidentally, they can cover the opening area and help avoid difficulties using a special sponge saturated in adhesive. * **Hemorrhage and Infarction -** One possible cause of subdural hematoma is injury to the bridge veins that connect the superior sagittal sinus (midline vein) to the brain surface. Excessive brain retraction can result in intraparenchymal hemorrhaging (bleeding in the parenchyma of the brain). Damage to the pericallosal or callosomarginal arteries (both branches of the anterior cerebral artery) may cause an infarction (tissue death due to decreased blood supply) in the anterior cerebral artery's area. To prevent injury to bridging veins, brain parenchyma, and arteries, performing gentle brain retraction is crucial, replacing the spatula multiple times and covering arteries with rayon

(both branches of the anterior cerebral artery) may cause an infarction (tissue death due to decreased blood supply) in the anterior cerebral artery's area. To prevent injury to bridging veins, brain parenchyma, and arteries, performing gentle brain retraction is crucial, replacing the spatula multiple times and covering arteries with rayon patties during all microsurgical procedures. **How Is the Recovery and Rehabilitation Process Post-surgery?** Depending on their pre-surgery neurologic state, each person recovers from a corpus callosotomy differently. A return to routine activities is expected within six to eight weeks of hospitalization, which usually lasts several days. However, recovery times vary depending on possible adverse effects and the depth of the callosotomy. After surgery, patients are expected to continue using antiseizure drugs even when the operation does not eliminate seizures. Short-term consequences of surgery could include sadness, exhaustion, headaches, memory problems, nausea, numbness where the incision was made, and trouble speaking. Any alarming symptoms, such as increasing or severe seizures, chronic headaches or nausea, or evidence of an infection, such as slurred speech or sudden paralysis on one side, should be reported to the healthcare professional at once. ## What Are the Key Considerations in Addressing Disconnection Syndrome and Selecting Corpus Callosotomy Approaches for Seizure Control? Disconnection syndrome, classified as acute or chronic, is the main reason for concern following CC. Patients with acute cases have major reductions in spontaneous speech, nondominant limb paresis (weakening), and incontinence. The severity varies; some may need to be fed through a tube or receive

Callosotomy Approaches for Seizure Control? Disconnection syndrome, classified as acute or chronic, is the main reason for concern following CC. Patients with acute cases have major reductions in spontaneous speech, nondominant limb paresis (weakening), and incontinence. The severity varies; some may need to be fed through a tube or receive the nutrition intravenously because of a substantial reduction in activity. Aspiration pneumonia (lung infection triggered by oral content aspiration) can also be caused by severe dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). Over several weeks to months, these symptoms usually become better. Alien hand syndrome, dichotic listening suppression, tactile dysnomia, hemispatial neglect, nondominant hand agraphia, and tachistoscopic visual suppression are among the symptoms that people with chronic disconnection syndrome may suffer. Varying degrees of severity, especially in older people, may result in impairment. Regarding seizure outcomes, total corpus callosotomy (tCC) has proven superior to anterior two-thirds callosotomy (aCC). But to reduce the danger of disconnection syndrome, aCC is recommended for older patients as it protects the corpus callosum's splenium. Standardized standards for selecting aCC over tCC are still pending. Patients over 15 are eligible for aCC, while patients under 10 are only eligible for tCC. The degree of CC is assessed in patients between the ages of ten and 15 using information from their electroencephalogram, everyday activities, and cognitive abilities. Additional posterior one-third callosotomy (pCC), usually performed at least three months after aCC, is suggested if seizure control is still insufficient. **Conclusion** To perform a corpus callosotomy (CC), basic neurosurgical methods must be used.

Preserving a low incidence of problems is essential to CC's acceptability as a surgical option for epilepsy that reduces seizures. Prioritizing careful surgical procedures and strategies to reduce the complication rate is imperative for surgeons doing this treatment. The doctors treat every case differently for the best outcome of the surgery. </content> </article> <article> <slug>pyridoxine-dependent-epilepsy</slug> <content>## **What Is Epilepsy?** While epilepsy is a common condition, it is also highly unique to each individual who experiences it. The severity and frequency of seizures can vary greatly, as can the symptoms that occur during seizures. Additionally, the causes of epilepsy are diverse and can include genetic factors, brain injuries, and certain medical conditions. Although it can be a lifelong condition, the management and treatment of epilepsy are also unique to each person and may involve medication, lifestyle changes, and/or surgical interventions. Despite the challenges it presents, many individuals with epilepsy are able to lead full and fulfilling lives with proper management and support. ## **What Is Pyridoxine-Dependent Epilepsy?** Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy is a condition characterized by prolonged seizures that can lead to muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness.

to lead full and fulfilling lives with proper management and support. ## **What Is Pyridoxine-Dependent Epilepsy?** Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy is a condition characterized by prolonged seizures that can lead to muscle rigidity, convulsions, and loss of consciousness. Unlike other forms of epilepsy, anticonvulsant drugs are ineffective in controlling seizures in individuals with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy. Instead, treatment involves large daily doses of pyridoxine, a type of vitamin B6 found in food. Without proper treatment, this condition can lead to severe brain dysfunction and developmental delays. Although controlling seizures with pyridoxine is possible, individuals with this condition may still experience long-term neurological problems. Pyridoxine dependence is a rare condition that can cause neonatal seizures and irreversible intellectual disability if not treated promptly. Previous studies have reported rapid clinical seizure control within seconds to minutes and EEG control within minutes to days. Due to its rarity, the absence of a specific laboratory test, and the limited information on EEG response to treatment, the diagnosis of pyridoxine dependence may be overlooked by clinicians. ## What Causes Pyridoxine-Dependent Epilepsy? It is caused by mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene, which provides instructions for making an enzyme called Î±-aminoadipic semialdehyde (Î±-AASA) dehydrogenase, also known as antiquitin. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down the amino acid lysine in the brain. When there is a deficiency of antiquitin, a molecule that interferes with vitamin B6 function builds up in various tissues. Pyridoxine is involved in various processes in the body, such as the breakdown of amino acids and the

is responsible for breaking down the amino acid lysine in the brain. When there is a deficiency of antiquitin, a molecule that interferes with vitamin B6 function builds up in various tissues. Pyridoxine is involved in various processes in the body, such as the breakdown of amino acids and the production of neurotransmitters, which transmit signals in the brain. It is still unknown how a lack of pyridoxine leads to the seizures that are characteristic of this condition. Although mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene are the primary cause of pyridoxine- dependent epilepsy, some individuals with this condition do not have identified mutations in this gene. ## What Are the Alternative Names for Pyridoxine-Dependent Epilepsy? * Pyridoxine dependency with seizures. * Pyridoxine-dependent seizures. * Epilepsy, pyridoxine-dependent. * PDE (pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy). * Vitamin B6-dependent seizures. * Pyridoxine dependency. * EPD (epilepsy, pyridoxine-dependent). * AASA dehydrogenase deficiency. ## **What Are the Symptoms of Pyridoxine-Dependent Epilepsy?** The clinical characteristics of pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy - ALDH7A1 (PDE- ALDH7A1) are distinct and involve seizures that are not well-controlled by conventional anti-seizure medication. However, these seizures can be clinically and electrographically responsive to high daily doses of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), regardless of whether the patient presents with classic or atypical PDE-ALDH7A1. Those with classic PDE-ALDH7A1 usually experience untreated seizures within the first few weeks or months of life, including prolonged seizures and recurrent episodes of status epilepticus. Atypical PDE-ALDH7A1, on the other hand, may present with later onset seizures, seizures that respond to anti-seizure medication but become intractable.

or atypical PDE-ALDH7A1. Those with classic PDE-ALDH7A1 usually experience untreated seizures within the first few weeks or months of life, including prolonged seizures and recurrent episodes of status epilepticus. Atypical PDE-ALDH7A1, on the other hand, may present with later onset seizures, seizures that respond to anti-seizure medication but become intractable. Electrographic seizures may occur without clinical symptoms. **Clinical Features:** * Some of the indications for seizure disorder in infants and children include seizures in any child under one year of age without any apparent brain malformation or acquired brain injury. * In neonates, the phenotype may indicate hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, making seizures difficult to control. * Signs of encephalopathy such as irritability, restlessness, abnormal crying, and vomiting may precede or follow the actual seizures. * In previously healthy infants, cryptogenic seizures may occur without an abnormal gestational or perinatal history. * Seizures that are only partially responsive to anti-seizure medication, especially when accompanied by developmental delay and intellectual disability, can also be present in infants and children. * A history of seizures that were either transient or unclearly responsive to pyridoxine may also be noted. * Focal or unilateral seizures that are difficult to treat with anti-seizure medications, and are often associated with partial preservation of consciousness, may also be observed. * Additionally, seizures that are responsive to folinic acid may be present in infants and children. ## **How Is Pyridoxine-Dependent Epilepsy Diagnosed?** When a patient shows a positive response to pyridoxine treatment and has elevated levels of alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde (Î±-AASA)

associated with partial preservation of consciousness, may also be observed. * Additionally, seizures that are responsive to folinic acid may be present in infants and children. ## **How Is Pyridoxine-Dependent Epilepsy Diagnosed?** When a patient shows a positive response to pyridoxine treatment and has elevated levels of alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde (Î±-AASA) in urine or plasma, pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE-ALDH7A1) is usually suspected. A confirmed diagnosis of PDE-ALDH7A1 is made when the patient has clinical features consistent with the condition and carries two pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene, which can be detected through molecular genetic testing. ## **How Is Pyridoxine-Dependent Epilepsy Treated?** * **Pyridoxine Supplements-** To manage PDE-ALDH7A1, there is currently no cure available. The only treatment option is lifelong supplementation of Pyridoxine, which requires targeted therapy. The optimal dose of Pyridoxine has not been studied due to the rarity of the condition. The International PDE Consortium recommends Pyridoxine doses according to age, ranging from 100 mg/day for newborns to a maximum of 500 mg/day for adults. Additionally, dietary modifications targeting the reduction of lysine intake are recommended. * **Supportive Care-** Supportive care for developmental delay and intellectual disability follows standard practice. The treating neurologist should regularly assess the control of epilepsy via targeted therapy with Pyridoxine, the need for anti-seizure medication, and signs of sensory neuropathy. Furthermore, the individual's developmental progress and educational needs should be evaluated regularly. * **Risk Assessment-** To evaluate relatives at risk, prenatal molecular genetic testing of fetuses can be performed to inform maternal

control of epilepsy via targeted therapy with Pyridoxine, the need for anti-seizure medication, and signs of sensory neuropathy. Furthermore, the individual's developmental progress and educational needs should be evaluated regularly. * **Risk Assessment-** To evaluate relatives at risk, prenatal molecular genetic testing of fetuses can be performed to inform maternal pyridoxine supplementation during pregnancy and facilitate the initiation of treatment at birth. In cases where prenatal testing is not pursued, the neonate should receive therapeutic doses of Pyridoxine until molecular genetic testing for the family-specific ALDH7A1 variants has been completed. PDE-ALDH7A1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an ALDH7A1 pathogenic variant, each sibling of an affected individual has a 25 % chance of being affected, a 50 % chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25 % chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for relatives at risk, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing for PDE- ALDH7A1 are possible. Genetic counseling is recommended to guide individuals and families affected by this condition. **Conclusion** Pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy is a genetic disorder. It is caused by mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene, which is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Seizures in this condition usually begin in infancy or, in rare instances, before birth. The seizures are characterized by muscle rigidity, convulsions, and tonic-clonic seizures, which can last for several minutes and result in a loss of consciousness. </content> </article> <article> <slug>symptomatic-generalized-epilepsy</slug> <content>**Introduction** Epilepsy

During epilepsy, the patient shows unusual movements and becomes unaware of the surroundings. A seizure is a sudden increase in the brain's electrical activity that is uncontrollable by the patient. A person experiencing two or more seizures without any triggering factors within 24 hours is suspicious of having epilepsy. Epilepsy is considered to be one of the most common diseases of the nervous system that affects people of all age groups. ## What Is Symptomatic Generalized Epilepsy? Symptomatic generalized epilepsy is a type of epilepsy in which the patient experiences multiple episodes of seizures, and the level of brain dysfunction is more than the other forms of epilepsy. In symptomatic generalized epilepsy, seizures create disturbances in a generalized pattern involving all the areas of the brain. Most of the patients with symptomatic generalized epilepsy have an already existing brain disorder or injury. ## What Are the Causes of Symptomatic Generalized Epilepsy?

The various causes of symptomatic generalized epilepsy are as follows: * Previous history of a brain injury like trauma or a strong blow on the head. * Conditions like meningitis (swelling of the outer covering layers of the brain and spinal cord) and encephalitis (swelling of the brain caused due to viral or bacterial infections, insect bites, and other diseases). * Brain tumor (abnormal growth of cells seen in the brain). * In some cases, symptomatic generalized epilepsy occurs due to genetic influence, as researchers have linked it to certain genes. It can also occur as a result of a family history of epilepsy. * Arteriovenous malformations in the brain (tangling of blood vessels that link arteries and veins in the brain). * Stroke (disturbance in the blood supply to the brain leading to lack of oxygen which in turn results in the death of brain cells). * Developmental disorders like autism (a disorder of the brain in which way of social interaction, communication, and behavior are different from normal people). * Brain damage observed in babies before birth may be due to infection in the mother and lack of nutrition. * Excessive use of alcohol or drugs. * History of prolonged fever in childhood accompanied by seizures. * Infections like cerebral palsy (a disorder that is characterized by disturbances in movement, balance, and

Rapid blinking of the eyes. * Loss of bladder control (inability to control the release or hold of urine). * The patient does not respond to the voice or touch of nearby people. ## How to Diagnose Symptomatic Generalized Epilepsy? The initial step of diagnosis includes a detailed medical history in which the doctor gets information from the patient regarding his symptoms. The doctor advises conducting some diagnostic tests that are as follows: * **Blood tests:** These are done to find out if the patient has any infection or genetic condition that may be associated with epilepsy. * **Neurological Examination:** The doctor may test the patient's behavior, mental state, and ability to maintain balance and perform basic tasks like walking and running. * **Computerized Tomography (CT) Scan:** In this procedure, x-rays that show cross-sectional images of the brain are obtained. This helps to determine the presence of any tumors, bleeding blood vessels, and other abnormalities in the brain that may be the cause of epilepsy. * **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** This test uses large magnets, a computer, and radiowaves to obtain a detailed picture of the brain. It helps to find out the presence of abnormalities in the brain that may be the reason for epilepsy. This test gives a clearer image than a CT scan. * **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** It is one of the most common tests that is conducted to diagnose epilepsy. In this procedure, electrodes are attached to the scalp of the patient to record the electrical activity

may be the reason for epilepsy. This test gives a clearer image than a CT scan. * **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** It is one of the most common tests that is conducted to diagnose epilepsy. In this procedure, electrodes are attached to the scalp of the patient to record the electrical activity of the brain. In patients with a history of epilepsy, the brain waves appear to be abnormal. The doctor may monitor and record the seizures when the patient is awake and asleep. This is evident even when the person is not having an episode of epilepsy during the time of the test. This test enables the doctor to find out the nature of the seizure and also to rule out other brain disorders. High-density electroencephalogram is an advanced variant of the conventional electroencephalogram in which the electrodes are placed very closely on the scalp. This test gives more accurate information about the seizures and the regions in the brain affected by the seizures. * **Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scans:** In this test, a low-dose radioactive material is injected into the vein to detect brain activity and abnormalities present in the brain. Areas with decreased brain activity indicate the regions of seizures. * **Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT):** In this test, a low dose of radioactive material is injected into the vein to obtain a clear three-dimensional view of the blood flow inside the brain. Regions showing a higher amount of blood flow are the areas where the seizures originate.

seizures. * **Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT):** In this test, a low dose of radioactive material is injected into the vein to obtain a clear three-dimensional view of the blood flow inside the brain. Regions showing a higher amount of blood flow are the areas where the seizures originate. This procedure is done in patients in which MRI and EEG cannot detect the location of the origin of the seizure. * **Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM):** This method shows the brain areas with higher blood flow than normal areas. This gives idea information about the areas inside the brain where the seizures begin. ## How to Treat Symptomatic Generalized Epilepsy? The different treatment options available to treat symptomatic generalized epilepsy are as follows: * **Medications** : Most people are relieved from the symptoms after taking anti-epileptic medications prescribed by the doctor. In other patients, taking medicines reduces the duration of occurrence and intensity of the seizures. The dosage of the medications is based on the age of the patient and the frequency and intensity of seizures. The doctor may prescribe a low dosage initially that may be increased over time depending on the frequency of seizures. Most of the patients are asked to stop the medications one or two years after the symptoms have disappeared. * **Vagus Nerve Stimulation:** This method is employed when medications are ineffective. This method involves the surgical placement of a device called a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) below the collarbone in the chest region. Wires

are asked to stop the medications one or two years after the symptoms have disappeared. * **Vagus Nerve Stimulation:** This method is employed when medications are ineffective. This method involves the surgical placement of a device called a vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) below the collarbone in the chest region. Wires or electrodes are connected from the device to the vagus nerve in the neck region. The device sends electrical energy to the brain through the vagus nerve depending on the intensity of the seizure. This method reduces the intensity of seizures by about 40 to 50 percent. Most people who undergo this treatment are still advised to continue the anti-epileptic medicines. * **Deep Brain Stimulation:** In this method, electrodes are placed into specific areas of the brain. These electrodes are connected to a device or generator placed inside the chest. The device sends electrical impulses to the brain at regular intervals. This helps to reduce the severity of seizures. * **Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS):** This involves the surgical placement of a neuro space responsive neurostimulation (RNS) device inside the skull. This device is connected to two electrodes that are placed in the region of the brain where seizures begin. The device detects the activity of the brain and the beginning of seizures. The device records the brain waves and the onset of seizures and sends an electrical charge that stops the seizures. * **Diet Therapy:** This is an effective method employed in children to reduce the episodes of seizures. The ketogenic

detects the activity of the brain and the beginning of seizures. The device records the brain waves and the onset of seizures and sends an electrical charge that stops the seizures. * **Diet Therapy:** This is an effective method employed in children to reduce the episodes of seizures. The ketogenic diet, which is a diet with high-fat content, low carbohydrates, and adequate amounts of protein, is the most common form of diet employed in diet therapy. In this method, the body makes use of energy that is obtained from the breaking down of fats. This diet is started after admitting the child to the hospital, and it may take up to four to five days to get used to the diet pattern. Another form of diet is the modified Atkin's diet which is a less restrictive form of the ketogenic diet. * **Surgery:** This is done in patients with severe seizure attacks that do not reduce with medications. In the surgical method, the doctor may remove a small part of the brain that is responsible for seizures. This method is performed if the portion of the brain responsible for the seizures is very small and the removal does not affect any functions like speech, hearing, or vision. Less invasive techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided stereotactic radiosurgery that uses minimal laser radiation to destroy the specific area of the brain responsible for causing seizures are also being used. Gamma knife radiosurgery is one of the frequently used types of

Less invasive techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided stereotactic radiosurgery that uses minimal laser radiation to destroy the specific area of the brain responsible for causing seizures are also being used. Gamma knife radiosurgery is one of the frequently used types of radiosurgery that employs the use of gamma radiations to target a specific area. **Conclusion** Uncontrolled and untreated seizures may affect the life of certain patients severely, which may lead to depression. Hence it is important to educate oneself and family members about the nature of the disease. Early detection and prompt treatment help the patient to lead a normal life. Therefore it is very important to find a doctor at the right time and start a treatment that helps to relieve the symptoms and lead a healthy life. </content> </article> <article> <slug>cannabidiol</slug> <content>**Overview:** The Cannabis sativa plant contains around 80 chemicals which are known as Cannabinoids. Cannabidiol (CBD) is obtained from hemp, a form of Cannabis sativa plant. Decarboxylation from a cannabidiolic acid precursor forms a 21-carbon terpenophenolic compound called Cannabidiol. The medicine can also be synthesized artificially. A prescription form of CBD is used for the treatment of epilepsy. CBD is also used for the management of pain, anxiety, dystonia, Crohn's disease, and Parkinson's disease. However, not much scientific evidence is available to support the same.

CBD is also used for the management of pain, anxiety, dystonia, Crohn's disease, and Parkinson's disease. However, not much scientific evidence is available to support the same. A law was passed in 2018 to sell hemp and hemp products in the United States. CBD is a prescription medicine that cannot be legally used in food and dietary supplements. However, it can be used as a part of cosmetic products. A prescription product named Epidiolex manufactured by GW pharmaceuticals is legally approved by the United States FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for the treatment of seizures caused by Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), Dravet syndrome (DS), and tuberous sclerosis complex. Other than the prescription product Epidiolex, the effectiveness of other forms of Cannabidiol for the treatment of seizures is not established. Epidiolex has completed phase III trials and is under current review for approval for use in the United States. CBD is also a part of various products like gums, supplements, oils, and high- concentration extracts available for the treatment of various ailments; however, it is marked normally as unapproved for medical use. CBD is a well- tolerated medicine, with adverse effects reported only in patients using drugs for other conditions that lead to drug interactions. Also, there is no evidence regarding public health problems associated with using a pure form of CBD. ## How Does Cannabidiol Work?

to drug interactions. Also, there is no evidence regarding public health problems associated with using a pure form of CBD. ## How Does Cannabidiol Work? CBD works by reducing neuronal hyperexcitability and inflammation by modulating intracellular calcium via GPR55 and TRPV1 channels and modulation of adenosine-mediated signaling. Studies are in progress to know the way Cannabidiol works at the molecular level. It is believed to produce multiple effects through various molecular pathways. Though CBD has a less binding affinity for CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors, Cannabinoid works through non- cannabinoid receptors and ion channels. It also acts through several receptor- independent pathways. Cannabinoid activates serotonin receptors, vanilloid receptors, GPR 55 (G-protein coupled receptor) orphan receptors, and PPARS - nuclear receptors. Three critical phase III randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multi-center trials showed the efficacy and safety of CBD in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS). There were changes from the baseline for drop seizure frequency in LGS and convulsive seizure frequency in DS patients. **Indications and Uses of Cannabidiol:** Besides its prominent use in the treatment of epileptic seizures, Cannabidiol is also effective in treating multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease affecting the central nervous system (CNS), causing inflammation and lesions around the nerve fibers. A prescription product consisting of a nasal spray under the trade name sativex, manufactured by GW pharmaceuticals, is a combination of 9-delta-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol that has been found useful for reducing pain, muscle tightness, and frequency of urination in MS patients. However, there is

lesions around the nerve fibers. A prescription product consisting of a nasal spray under the trade name sativex, manufactured by GW pharmaceuticals, is a combination of 9-delta-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol that has been found useful for reducing pain, muscle tightness, and frequency of urination in MS patients. However, there is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of Cannabidiol use alone for treating MS symptoms. A Cannabidiol spray to be used under the tongue is found effective solely in decreasing pain and muscle tightness in MS patients; however, patients' overall quality of life was not found to improve. **For Patients:** ## What Is Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome? Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a rare and severe form of epilepsy that begins in early childhood. It affects children between the ages of two to six years. The condition is characterized by frequent seizures that can be of several types. Along with seizures, the children also develop learning disabilities, developmental delays, and behavioral problems that can range from mild to severe. The causes of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome can be a lack of oxygen at birth, brain injuries, brain infections, or genetic abnormalities. Treatment helps reduce the frequency of seizures using a combination of drugs. Also, a ketogenic diet incorporating lesser carbohydrates and more fats helps reduce the intensity of seizures in children. ## What Is Dravet Syndrome? Dravet syndrome is also a rare form of the epileptic disorder, also called myoclonic epilepsy of infancy that starts in early infancy. The first seizure occurs in the first year of life,

lesser carbohydrates and more fats helps reduce the intensity of seizures in children. ## What Is Dravet Syndrome? Dravet syndrome is also a rare form of the epileptic disorder, also called myoclonic epilepsy of infancy that starts in early infancy. The first seizure occurs in the first year of life, that lasts for more than five minutes, and is triggered by a high fever. Along with variations in the seizure types and frequency, the seizures are also accompanied by developmental delays. Dravet syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder due to the transmission of a mutated SCN1A gene. The genetic mutations can be mild, causing migraine headaches, moderate forms of epilepsy, and the most severe form of epilepsy, Dravet syndrome. Complications of Dravet syndrome can be status epilepticus (continuous seizures) or SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy). Medications are used for the treatment of epileptic attacks. They work by reducing the frequency of attacks. ## What Is Tuberous Sclerosis? Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes the growth of benign tumors in different body parts. The signs and symptoms vary in type and severity based on the location of the growths. The condition usually starts in infancy or childhood. Tuberous sclerosis can involve the skin, eyes, heart, lungs, and brain. Also, the affected children experience cognitive impairment and learning disabilities. Growths in the brain can cause symptoms like seizures, which is one of the earliest signs of tuberous sclerosis. The treatment is usually symptomatic that involves managing and treating

Growths in the brain can cause symptoms like seizures, which is one of the earliest signs of tuberous sclerosis. The treatment is usually symptomatic that involves managing and treating the symptoms to prevent them from developing into complications. **For Doctors:** **Chemical Name:** 2-[(6R)-3-methyl-6-prop-1-en-2-ylcyclohex-2-en-1- yl]-5-pentylbenzene-1,3-diol. **Physical Appearance:** CBD is a crystalline solid. **Chemical Properties:** Melting point - 62 to 63 degrees Celsius. Solubility - Approximately 23.6 mg/mL in dimethyl sulphoxide and ethanol. **Ease of Convertibility Into Controlled Substances:** A few studies indicate the convertibility of Cannabidiol (CBD) into tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). There are also pieces of evidence about spontaneous conversion in vivo; however, additional research has suggested the transformation occurs only in specific experimental conditions and is unlikely to occur upon oral administration of CBD in humans. **Routes of Administration:** Currently, there are several CBD medicinal products under development. In research studies and clinical trials, CBD was administered orally, either in the form of capsules or dissolved in an oil solution like olive oil or sesame oil. CBD can also be administered through intranasal or sublingual routes. The oral doses reported in the literature ranged from 100 to 800 mg/kg per day. **Dosage and Administration:** Cannabidiol is available in the form of oils, creams, and tablets. The medical use and exact dosage of the drug are as below: **The Recommended Dosage for Treatment of Seizures in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Dravet Syndrome:**

in the literature ranged from 100 to 800 mg/kg per day. **Dosage and Administration:** Cannabidiol is available in the form of oils, creams, and tablets. The medical use and exact dosage of the drug are as below: **The Recommended Dosage for Treatment of Seizures in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Dravet Syndrome:** The initial dose of Cannabidiol is 2.5 mg/kg to be taken orally twice daily. After a week, the dosage can be increased to a 5 mg/kg oral dose twice a day if well tolerated by the patient. In patients who require further seizure reduction, the dose can be increased by 2.5 mg/kg per day. The maximum dose of Cannabidiol is 20 mg/kg/day. The maintenance dose is 10 to 20 mg/kg/day. A dosage of 20 mg/kg/day has shown an increased reduction in the rate of seizures; however, it was associated with a greater risk of adverse effects. In pediatric patients aged one year and older, the maintenance dose is 10 to 20 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. Standard dosing with meals is advised to reduce variability in the plasma exposure of Cannabidiol. **The Recommended Dosage for Treatment of Seizures in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex:** The initial dose of Cannabidiol is 2.5 mg/kg to be taken orally twice a day. A weekly increment of 2.5 mg/kg to a maximum dose of 12.5 mg/kg per day is recommended. In patients requiring a rapid titration, the dosage is increased not very frequently than every other day. The maximum dose is 25 mg/kg/day, and the maintenance

to be taken orally twice a day. A weekly increment of 2.5 mg/kg to a maximum dose of 12.5 mg/kg per day is recommended. In patients requiring a rapid titration, the dosage is increased not very frequently than every other day. The maximum dose is 25 mg/kg/day, and the maintenance dose is 12.5 mg/kg orally twice a day. The effectiveness of the drug, when used at doses lower than 25 mg/kg/day, is yet to be studied. Standard dosing with meals is advised to reduce variability in the plasma exposure of Cannabidiol. **Dose Adjustments:** **Dose Adjustments in Renal Impairment Patients:** No dose adjustment is recommended in renal impairment patients. **Dose Adjustments in Hepatic Impairment Patients:** There is no dosage adjustment recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment. In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the initial dose is 1.25 mg/kg to be taken orally twice a day, followed by 2.5 to 5 mg/kg orally twice a day (for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome). A maintenance dose of 6.25 mg/kg is to be administered twice a day (for tuberous sclerosis). In patients with severe hepatic impairment, the initial dose is 0.5 mg/kg to be taken orally twice a day, with a maintenance dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg orally twice a day (for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome), and 2.5 mg/kg orally twice a day (for tuberous sclerosis). Slower dose titration is recommended for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Also, it is advised to stop the therapy in patients whose transaminase

of 1 to 2 mg/kg orally twice a day (for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome), and 2.5 mg/kg orally twice a day (for tuberous sclerosis). Slower dose titration is recommended for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Also, it is advised to stop the therapy in patients whose transaminase levels are three times the upper limit of normal and bilirubin two times the upper limit of normal. **Dose Adjustments in Elderly Patients:** The selection of dosage has to be done cautiously in elderly patients, usually starting with the lower end of the dosage range. During discontinuation of the therapy, a gradual reduction of the dose is recommended to reduce the risk of status epilepticus and increased seizure frequency. **Warnings and Precautions:** The use of the drug is contraindicated in the following conditions: * The patient has a hypersensitivity to any active substance or product excipients. * In patients younger than one year, the safety and efficacy of the drug are yet to be studied. * The use of Cannabidiol is contraindicated in pregnant and breastfeeding women as the drug can be contaminated with other ingredients causing harmful effects on the fetus or the infant. * Research suggests that taking high doses of Cannabidiol can worsen the tremors and muscle movements in patients with Parkinson's disease. **Administration Advice:** * The drug is recommended for oral administration only. * It has to be taken consistently, either with or without food, to reduce the variability in plasma exposure. * A calibrated measuring

high doses of Cannabidiol can worsen the tremors and muscle movements in patients with Parkinson's disease. **Administration Advice:** * The drug is recommended for oral administration only. * It has to be taken consistently, either with or without food, to reduce the variability in plasma exposure. * A calibrated measuring device must be used to ensure accuracy in dosage. * Enteral feeding tubes like nasogastric tubes can be used for liquid forms of the drug. However, the use of tubes made up of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is contraindicated. **Drug Interactions:** Cannabinoids THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (Cannabidiol) are metabolized by the CYP-450 (cytochrome P450) enzyme system. Studies conducted in animal models have shown that CBD inhibits the enzymes CYP3, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 and induces the drugs metabolized by the CYP2B enzyme. In addition, it has been found that CBD was an inhibitor of a few transporter systems. The following drug interactions were noted when specific drugs were used with CBD for certain medical conditions. 1. **Cilostazol:** CYP2C19 is the enzyme that metabolizes the substrate Cilostazol. CBD is a CYP2C19 inhibitor, which increases the serum concentration of Cilostazol. It is recommended to consider therapy modification. 2. **Citalopram:** CYP2C19 inhibitors moderately increase the serum concentration of the substrate Citalopram. Therefore, a therapy modification is recommended. 3. **Clobazam:** Studies have shown that CBD interacts with 2C19 substrate, leading to increased Clobazam levels. It is studied that CBD increases the serum levels of the active metabolites of Clobazam. It is recommended to monitor the

the serum concentration of the substrate Citalopram. Therefore, a therapy modification is recommended. 3. **Clobazam:** Studies have shown that CBD interacts with 2C19 substrate, leading to increased Clobazam levels. It is studied that CBD increases the serum levels of the active metabolites of Clobazam. It is recommended to monitor the therapy as the interactions are common only during oral administration of CBD. 4. **Clopidogrel:** CYP2C19 inhibitors are found to moderately decrease the serum concentrations of the active metabolites of Clopidogrel. 5. **CNS depressants:** CBD is found to enhance the CNS depressant effects of CNS depressants. It is recommended to monitor the therapy. 6. **CYP2C19 Inducers:** Strong CYP2C19 inducers can decrease the serum concentration of CBD. 7. **CYP2C19 Inhibitors:** Moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19 can increase the serum concentration of CBD. It is recommended to monitor the therapy. 8. **CYP2C19 Inhibitors:** Strong CYP2C19 inhibitors increase the serum concentration of CBD. 9. **CYP2C19 Substrates:** Moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19 are found to decrease the metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates. 10. **CYP3A4 Inducers:** Strong inducers of CYP3A4 decrease the serum concentration of CBD. 11. **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** Moderate and strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 can increase the serum concentration of CBD. Monitoring of therapy is advised to increase or decrease the serum concentrations of CBD due to drug interactions. The drug interactions between CBD and various other drugs include: **Sedative Medications and CBD:** Both Cannabidiol and sedatives (CNS depressants) can cause drowsiness and slow breathing. Therefore, a combination of drugs has to be avoided. **Clobazam and CBD:** The

or decrease the serum concentrations of CBD due to drug interactions. The drug interactions between CBD and various other drugs include: **Sedative Medications and CBD:** Both Cannabidiol and sedatives (CNS depressants) can cause drowsiness and slow breathing. Therefore, a combination of drugs has to be avoided. **Clobazam and CBD:** The liver metabolizes Clobazam. CBD decreases the speed of metabolization of Clobazam which can increase the actions and side effects. **Eslicarbazepine and CBD:** CBD affects how quickly the body breaks down Eslicarbazepine. This increases the serum concentration of Eslicarbazepine in the body in small amounts. **Rufinamide and CBD:** CBD can increase the levels of Rufinamide in the body by affecting the way how quickly it is metabolized in the body. **Topiramate and CBD:** Topiramate levels are also found to increase by small amounts when administered along with CBD. **Valproate and CBD:** Valproic acid can damage the liver. When Valproate and CBD are prescribed together, it can increase the chances of liver injury. Either of the drugs has to be stopped, or the dosages have to be reduced. **Zonisamide and CBD:** The serum levels of Zonisamide have also been found to increase in small quantities when prescribed, along with CBD. **Lithium and CBD:** Higher doses of CBD can increase the levels of lithium, thereby increasing lithium toxicity. **Warfarin and CBD:** CBD increases the levels of Warfarin in the body, which can increase the risk of bleeding. The other drugs whose levels can increase in the body when administered along with CBD include:

Chunk 109:
CBD:** Higher doses of CBD can increase the levels of lithium, thereby increasing lithium toxicity. **Warfarin and CBD:** CBD increases the levels of Warfarin in the body, which can increase the risk of bleeding. The other drugs whose levels can increase in the body when administered along with CBD include: * Brivaracetam. * Everolimus. * Tacrolimus. * Methadone. * Carbamazepine. * Sirolimus. * Stiripentol. * Tamoxifen. * Caffeine. * Citalopram. **Description:** Each packet of CBD oral capsules contains 15000 mg of decarboxylated Cannabis sativa and 300 mg of the active ingredient Cannabidiol (CBD). Each capsule of CBD delivers 10 mg of Cannabidiol. The medicine is prescribed for oral use. It is recommended to swallow the capsule and not chew. For best results, a CBD capsule has to be taken with or after food. **Pharmacokinetics:** The oral route of an oil-based capsule of CBD has been studied in humans. Due to its poor aqueous solubility, CBD absorption from the gut is difficult, resulting in a variable pharmacokinetic profile. The bioavailability of CBD was found to be six percent because of a significant first-pass metabolism. Aerosolized CBD was reported to reach peak plasma concentrations within five to ten minutes and have higher bioavailability compared to oral administration routes. CBD was found to get rapidly distributed into the tissues with a high volume of distribution around 32 L/kg. Also, the drug accumulation was mostly in the adipose tissue due to its lipophilic nature. CBD is greatly metabolized in the liver. A study on

bioavailability compared to oral administration routes. CBD was found to get rapidly distributed into the tissues with a high volume of distribution around 32 L/kg. Also, the drug accumulation was mostly in the adipose tissue due to its lipophilic nature. CBD is greatly metabolized in the liver. A study on the human liver microsomes suggested that pooled HLMs metabolized CBD into eight monohydroxylated metabolites. The seven recombinant enzymes that are capable of metabolizing CBD include: * CYP1A1. * CYP1A2. * CYP2C9. * CYP2C19. * CYP2D6. * CYP3A4. * CYP2C19. Studies have shown CBD inhibits CYP isoenzymes invitro; however, it is unclear whether this occurs at concentrations achieved by the use of clinical doses. **Mechanism of Action:** Cannabidiol reduces the hyperexcitability and inflammation of neurons through modulation of intracellular calcium via GRP55 and TRPV1 channels and modulation of adenosine-mediated signaling. **Absorption:** Cannabidiol exposure up to a dose of 6000 mg under fasting conditions has exhibited a nonlinear increase. The median time of peak plasma concentration (T max) for CBD ranges from two hours 30 minutes to five hours. The absolute bioavailability of the drug is yet to be determined. When taken with a high-fat meal, C max (peak concentration of the drug in a specific compartment of the body after the administration of the first dose and before the administration of the second dose) and AUC (area under the curve) of CBD is five-fold and four-fold respectively. **Distribution:** Studies have shown a high plasma binding of greater than 94 percent for

(6-OH-CBD, 7-OH-CBD, and 7-COOH- CBD). The estimated volume of distribution was 20963 L to 42849 L when observed in healthy volunteers. **Metabolism:** CBD is metabolized extensively in the liver and gut. The enzymes CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and UGTIA7, UGTIA9, and UGT2B7 are primarily involved in the metabolism. 7-COOH-CBD (7-carboxy-cannabidiol) and 7-OH-CBD are the major circulating metabolites of CBD, whereas 6-OH-CBD (6-hydroxy-cannabidiol) is the minor circulating metabolite. Non-clinical animal models of epilepsy have shown CBD and 7-OH-CBD to be the most abundant and active metabolites and 7-COOH-CBD to be the inactive metabolite. **Elimination:** The mean elimination half-life was between 56 to 61 hours in healthy volunteers who were administered doses of CBD twice daily for seven days. After administering a single dose of 5 mg/kg, the total radioactivity recovered after 168 hours was 94 percent, with the fecal route being 84 percent and small proportions recovered through urine being eight percent. **Pharmacodynamics:** CB1 and CB2 are the two important cannabinoid receptors. CB1 receptors are primarily located in CNS (central nervous system), with a few of them in the peripheral tissues. CB2 receptors are found on the cell peripheries of the immune system, GI (gastrointestinal tract), and at lower

being eight percent. **Pharmacodynamics:** CB1 and CB2 are the two important cannabinoid receptors. CB1 receptors are primarily located in CNS (central nervous system), with a few of them in the peripheral tissues. CB2 receptors are found on the cell peripheries of the immune system, GI (gastrointestinal tract), and at lower densities of the CNS. CBD has a low affinity for both CB1 and CB2 receptors with a low binding affinity. CBD was also found to interact with endocannabinoid systems through indirect mechanisms leading to an improved action of endogenous cannabinoid ligand anandamide. CBD was also studied to regulate non-endocannabinoid signaling systems. **Toxicology:** The potential toxic effects of CBD have been studied extensively during in vitro studies and animal studies. CBD was proven to have lower toxic effects comparatively; however, all the effects are yet to be explored. The below findings have been noted based on studies: * CBD affects the growth of tumor cells; however, there are no significant effects on the growth of other cells, except for a pro-apoptotic effect on the lymphocytes. * Limited research suggests no effect of CBD on embryonic development. * Effects on hormonal changes have a mixed result, with some studies pointing towards possible effects and others pointing to no effects. The result also depends on the hormone that is involved. * There are no significant effects on various physiological and biochemical parameters. * Effects on the immune system are unclear. However, there is evidence of stimulation of the immune system at lower concentrations

effects and others pointing to no effects. The result also depends on the hormone that is involved. * There are no significant effects on various physiological and biochemical parameters. * Effects on the immune system are unclear. However, there is evidence of stimulation of the immune system at lower concentrations of CBD and suppression of the immune system at higher concentrations of the drug. * CBD can cause certain drug interactions by inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes. However, it is not clear whether these interactions occur at physiological concentrations. **Adverse Reactions in Humans:** CBD does not produce any pronounced adverse effects, as noted with cannabinoids like THC. A number of clinical trials have shown that CBD is a well-tolerated drug with a good safety profile. **Dependence Potential in Humans:** Physical dependence effects like withdrawal and tolerance of CBD are yet to be reported in human studies. **Abuse Potential in Humans:** Though there is limited evidence, well-controlled clinical studies have shown that CBD does not pose a risk of abuse potential. **Effects on Pregnancy and Lactation:** There is limited evidence on the safe use and efficacy of CBD in pregnant and lactating females. As the endocannabinoid system plays a role in regulating fertility, the use of cannabis and disruption of the endocannabinoid system has shown a negative impact on reproduction. **Effect of Food Intake on the Bioavailability of the Drug:** A diet high in fat, when consumed after taking oral Cannabidiol has shown increased absorption of the drug compared to taking it

fertility, the use of cannabis and disruption of the endocannabinoid system has shown a negative impact on reproduction. **Effect of Food Intake on the Bioavailability of the Drug:** A diet high in fat, when consumed after taking oral Cannabidiol has shown increased absorption of the drug compared to taking it on an empty stomach. An oral capsule of CBD rather than a liquid form was found to have a precise determination of pharmacokinetic parameters. A university study was conducted in which the subjects were administered a single dose of 99 percent pure form of CBD under fasting and having a high-fat meal, whose blood samples were collected and assessed over a period of zero to 72 hours have shown a Cmax value of 14 times and AUC of four times higher in people who were fed a high- fat meal when compared to those who took the dose post fasting. **Drug Exposure at a Steady-State Following Therapeutic Dosing Regimen:** The mean overall exposure at a steady state of Cannabidiol at 10 mg/kg/day was 966 ng.hr/mL and at 20 mg/kg/day was 2000 ng.hr/mL in patients between the age groups of 18 and 55 years. **Dose Proportionality:** The pharmacokinetics of CBD was nonlinear over a dose range of 750 to 6000 mg in healthy subjects and 5 to 20 mg/kg/day in epilepsy patients. **Accumulation:** A mean accumulation ratio noted at a steady-state was between 1.79 and 2.0. **Variability:** Intra-subject variability is yet to be studied. Inter subject variability ranges from 35.1 percent

Inter subject variability ranges from 35.1 percent to 112.8 percent for Cannabidiol Cmax and 32.3 percent to 104.1 percent for Cannabidiol AUC. The central volume of distribution is 28 to 72 percent, and the peripheral volume of distribution is 91 percent. **Patient Information:** **Warnings:** Cannabidiol can harm the liver. Therefore it is advised to undergo liver function tests before starting and during the use of the drug. A doctor must be consulted when symptoms like nausea and vomiting, appetite loss, fatigue, right-sided upper abdominal pain, itching, dark-colored urine, or yellowish discoloration of the eyes and skin are noted. It is advisable to avoid driving or any hazardous activity before knowing the drug's actions on the body. Some patients may experience suicidal thoughts. They are advised to stay alert to their feelings and emotions and report any symptoms that worsen with time to the doctor. Things to Remember Before Taking Cannabidiol: * The medicine is to be avoided in people who are allergic to Cannabidiol or sesame seed oil. * It is not approved for use in patients less than two years of age. * Inform the doctor in case of pregnancy or breastfeeding. * People experiencing suicidal thoughts should inform the doctor right away. Also, the family

Also, the family and caregivers must be alert to notice the changes in the patient. * A history of liver disease or drug or alcohol addiction must be informed to the doctor. ## How Is Cannabidiol Taken? 1. The medicine has to be taken as per the prescribed dosage. It is advised to follow all the instructions given on the prescription label. 2. CBD has to be taken twice daily. Also, it is recommended to take medicine at the same time of the day. 3. CBD can be taken either with food or without food. However, the same pattern has to be followed every day. 4. CBD must be stored at room temperature, away from moisture and heat. 5. The medicine must not be frozen or refrigerated. 6. The laboratory staff must be informed about the use of Cannabidiol before a drug screening test, as the results may come positive for cannabis (Marijuana). 7. Cannabidiol should not be stopped suddenly as it can cause an increase in seizures. A doctor's advice is mandatory for tapering the dose of the drug. ## What Happens When a Dose Is Missed? The medicine must be taken as soon as possible when a dose is missed. However,

The medicine must be taken as soon as possible when a dose is missed. However, if it is the time for the next dose, then two doses at close intervals should be avoided. ## What Are the Things to Avoid When Taking Cannabidiol? It is recommended to avoid drinking alcohol when taking CBD as it can increase drowsiness. ## What Are the Side Effects of Cannabidiol? Along with the necessary effects, CBD can also cause some side effects. Not all the listed side effects can occur at once; however, when they occur, they require immediate medical attention. **Side Effects That Require Immediate Medical Attention:** **More Common:** * Agitation. * Chills. * Pain in the chest. * Cough. * Fever. * Dark urine. * Irritability. * Hoarseness of voice. * Lack of appetite. * Lower back pain. * Nausea and vomiting. * Painful urination. * Pale stools. * Sore throat. * Difficulty breathing. * Unusual fatigue. * Yellowing of eyes and skin. **Less Common:** * Aggression. * Anger. * Confusion. * Dizziness. * Diarrhea. * Rapid heartbeat. * Blue lips, nails, and skin. * Irregular, shallow breathing. * Abdominal pain. **Side Effects That Do Not Require Immediate Medical Attention Include:** Some side effects that occur when using the drug may not require medical attention as they

However, if they continue to persist, a doctor's consultation is necessary. **More Common:** * Rashes. * Difficulty sleeping. * Lack of strength. **Less Common:** * Increase in saliva. * Drooling. * Decrease in weight. * Unstable walking. </content> </article> <article> <slug>kidney-disease-and-epilepsy</slug> <content>**Introduction** Seizures refer to abnormal neurological functions marked by uncontrolled, spontaneous electrical activity in the brain. These fits tend to bring a sudden change in oneâ€™s behavior, movement, actions, or even feelings. One may experience two or more seizures within a day when suffering from epilepsy. It is important to note the incidence of seizures in patients with chronic kidney disease. The nephrologists often find it challenging to manage the epileptic incidents while simultaneously keeping the kidney disease in check. It may be possible for the person to be epileptic before the occurrence of kidney disease. However, many times, kidney-related etiologies such as uremic encephalopathy, dialysis, and hyponatremia may also be held responsible for the incidence of seizures.

kidney disease. However, many times, kidney-related etiologies such as uremic encephalopathy, dialysis, and hyponatremia may also be held responsible for the incidence of seizures. The use of anti-epileptic drugs needs to be cautiously monitored in patients with chronic kidney disease. This article aims to highlight this neglected problem in patients with kidney disease and discusses ways to manage seizure episodes. ## How Are Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Seizures Related? Seizures are not a disease but a symptom of a pre-existing disorder. Data suggests that ten percent of the world's population will suffer from a seizure at least once in their lifetime, out of which one percent will be deemed epileptic. The incidence of seizures in patients with chronic kidney disease accounts for ten percent. About one-third of patients with uremic encephalopathy develop seizures. There are two main categories of people when it comes to establishing a link between CKD and seizures: 1. People who develop provoked seizures are encountered during or due to CKD. 2. People who are already epileptic and develop CKD later. Recognizing the seizures and managing them effectively can be a serious challenge for clinicians, especially non-neurologists. There are varied types of seizures that one may suffer from. The seizure may be focal or generalized depending on the origin and level of motor movement involved. These include: * **Myoclonic Seizures:** These are seizures characterized by lightning-fast, sudden muscular movements. These seizures can be potentially harmful if they occur during mid-activities, such as driving or carrying something

suffer from. The seizure may be focal or generalized depending on the origin and level of motor movement involved. These include: * **Myoclonic Seizures:** These are seizures characterized by lightning-fast, sudden muscular movements. These seizures can be potentially harmful if they occur during mid-activities, such as driving or carrying something heavy. * **Focal Aware Seizures:** These are also referred to as focal onset seizures. These happen when a person is fully aware of his or her conscious self and surroundings. There can be slight alterations in the movements and feelings observed. However, the seizure is quite short-lived, mostly two minutes. * **Absence Seizures:** These seizures are marked by short, sudden lapses of the conscious state. The person experiencing this seizure may appear zoned out during the time of the seizure and may return to the alert state post-seizure. These seizures do not cause any potential harm to the patient. * **Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures:** A person experiencing a generalized tonic-clonic seizure loses consciousness and experiences muscular stiffness and jerks. Typically, these seizures begin on both sides of the brain and are generalized. * **Convulsive or Non-Convulsive Status Epilepticus (NCSE):** Depending on the type of seizure, different temporal thresholds apply to characterize unusually protracted seizures. This lasts five minutes for convulsive status epilepticus. The threshold for NCSE is ten minutes, where NCSE is defined as status epilepticus without noticeable motor signs. ## What Are the Causes of Seizures in Uremia? Seizures associated with uremic encephalopathy are also quite commonly seen. There is

unusually protracted seizures. This lasts five minutes for convulsive status epilepticus. The threshold for NCSE is ten minutes, where NCSE is defined as status epilepticus without noticeable motor signs. ## What Are the Causes of Seizures in Uremia? Seizures associated with uremic encephalopathy are also quite commonly seen. There is a vast array of reasons proposed that explain the cause of these seizures in uremia patients. 1. **Rapid Accumulation of Uremic Toxins:** It has been suggested that the build-up of guanidino compounds throughout uremia activates excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and inhibits inhibitory GABA receptors, perhaps leading to myoclonus and seizures. 2. **Enhanced Cortical Excitability:** A key component of how the human brain functions is cortical excitability, defined as the strength of a cortical neuron's reaction to a particular stimulus. This property represents neuron reactivity and response specificity. Increased cortical excitability may be the underlying cause of epilepsies and the tendency to experience seizures. 3. **Electrolyte Disbalance:** Seizures may be the only presenting symptom of acute or severe electrolyte abnormalities. Patients with hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and salt disordersâ€”particularly hyponatremiaâ€”are more likely to experience seizures. 4. **Dialysis Disequilibrium Syndrome:** Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome is the term used to describe neurological symptoms and indications that occur during or soon after dialysis. The osmotic fluid shift following hemodialysis is linked to the change in urea level. It is likely due to the quick removal of compounds like urea that build up in the blood. This may cause an imbalance in the fluid content of the brain's

occur during or soon after dialysis. The osmotic fluid shift following hemodialysis is linked to the change in urea level. It is likely due to the quick removal of compounds like urea that build up in the blood. This may cause an imbalance in the fluid content of the brain's cells, which may result in swelling and symptoms including headache, nausea, restlessness, confusion, or, in extreme situations, seizures, coma, and even death. 5. **Other Causes:** Air embolism, sepsis, antibiotic usage, subdural hematomas, higher incidence of stroke, and Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) are some of the other reasons that may contribute to the occurrence of seizures in patients with chronic kidney disease. ## What Are the Effects of Anti-Epileptic Drugs on the Kidney? The seizures encountered in a kidney disease patient are managed by administering anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). The drugs, however, pose a set of consequences that are borne by the kidney. These are: * **Nephrolithiasis:** This is the term given to kidney stones that may be small or large and cause immense pain during the passage of urine. * **Interstitial Nephritis:** This disease causes swelling (inflammation) in the gaps between the renal tubules. This may result in issues with renal function. * **Drug-Induced Lupus Nephritis:** The effect of drugs can cause kidney inflammation to aggravate into lupus. The cessation of the drug is advised in such cases. * **Hyponatremia:** Low levels of sodium in blood result from improperly administered AEDs. * **Hypokalemia and Hypomagnesemia:** An electrolyte imbalance can be

renal function. * **Drug-Induced Lupus Nephritis:** The effect of drugs can cause kidney inflammation to aggravate into lupus. The cessation of the drug is advised in such cases. * **Hyponatremia:** Low levels of sodium in blood result from improperly administered AEDs. * **Hypokalemia and Hypomagnesemia:** An electrolyte imbalance can be observed with AED administration that is not supervised or monitored according to the needs of the CKD patient. * **Peripheral Edema** : AED may occasionally result in fluid accumulation, leading to swelling in lower limbs. **Conclusion** Seizures affect approximately ten percent of patients with end-stage renal failure. Using a low threshold, measuring seizures in people with encephalopathy is recommended. It is strongly advised to keep a neurologist informed about any neurological symptoms a renal disease patient may be experiencing. Before starting any other form of treatment, the seizure's primary cause should always be addressed. When giving AEDs to patients with CKD and epilepsy, caution is required. </content> </article> <article> <slug>epilepsy-surgery</slug> <content>**Introduction:** Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal brain activity, which results in seizures of unusual behavior, sensations, and loss of awareness. It can affect anyone. Epilepsy affects both men and women of all races, ethnicities, and ages. The symptoms of a seizure can vary greatly.

symptoms of a seizure can vary greatly. During a seizure, some people with epilepsy stare blankly for a few seconds, while others twitch their arms or legs repeatedly. ## What Are the Risks of Epilepsy Surgery? Every surgery has risks. Typical surgical risks include the following: * Anesthesia reaction. * Bleeding. * Infection. * Tissue damage in the brain. * Healing at the surgical site is delayed. Aside from these risks, brain surgery can impact vital functions such as memory, speech, vision, and movement. These functions are distributed throughout the brain. The healthcare providers conduct extensive pre-surgery testing and brain mapping to pinpoint the source of the seizures. The surgical team will do everything possible to ensure that the planned surgery avoids these critical areas. ## What Are the Brain Surgeries Available for Epilepsy? The brain surgeries available for epilepsy are: **Surgical Resection** \- The neurosurgeon will remove a specific portion of the brain during resection surgery. The neurosurgeon may remove brain tissue near the site of the seizures or the abnormal brain tissue causing the seizures. There are various types of resections, such as: * Lesionectomy. * Multilobar resection. * Lobectomy. * Hemispherectomy. **Surgical Disconnection** \- The communication between the brain area causing the seizures and the remaining normal brain tissue is removed during these surgeries. * Corpus callosotomy. * Multiple subpial transections. **Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy** \- This procedure is less invasive than the other open surgeries. **Neuromodulation** \- This type of procedure involves implanting devices to improve

They are: * Vagus nerve stimulation. * Deep brain stimulation. * Responsive neurostimulation. ## How to Prepare for Epilepsy Surgery? If a person is a potential candidate for epilepsy surgery, they should work with a healthcare team at a specialized epilepsy center. Several tests are performed by the medical team to: * Determine the surgical eligibility. * Determine the best surgical site. * Learn in-depth how that part of the brain works. These are standard procedures for determining the source of abnormal brain activity: * **Electroencephalogram (EEG) at Baseline:** Electrodes are placed on the scalp in this test to measure electrical activity produced by the brain when a seizure is not present. This test, which can be performed while asleep or awake, can suggest general brain areas that may be affected. * **Video EEG:** Seizures are recorded in real-time using a continuous EEG with video monitoring. This test is performed in a hospital because seizure medications must be reduced or temporarily stopped for seizures to occur. * **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):**MRI employs a magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images that allow doctors to identify damaged cells, tumors, and other irregularities that can cause seizures. ##

is performed in a hospital because seizure medications must be reduced or temporarily stopped for seizures to occur. * **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):**MRI employs a magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images that allow doctors to identify damaged cells, tumors, and other irregularities that can cause seizures. ## What Is the Procedure of Epilepsy Surgery? First, the healthcare provider will shave the area of the head where the surgery will be performed. Next, the anesthesiologist will administer anesthesia to keep the person asleep during the surgery. Next, the healthcare team will closely monitor the heart rate, blood oxygen level, and blood pressure. During surgery, they may perform an EEG to confirm the precise location or source of the seizures. A person will not experience any discomfort during this stage of the procedure. After the brain mapping, the person will be put back to sleep. Next, the neurosurgeon will use the appropriate surgical approach to treat the area of brain tissue where the seizures occur. They will then bandage the head and close the skin covering the skull. ## What Is the Procedure After Epilepsy? After epilepsy surgery, there will be scalp and face swelling and headaches. The person will be given medications to alleviate these symptoms. Symptoms subside after a few weeks. Most people have a one-day intensive care stay followed by a three to four day hospital stay. One will need to take anti- seizure medication after the surgery. The medications protect the brain while it heals

will be given medications to alleviate these symptoms. Symptoms subside after a few weeks. Most people have a one-day intensive care stay followed by a three to four day hospital stay. One will need to take anti- seizure medication after the surgery. The medications protect the brain while it heals and reduce the chances of having seizures later on. A person will need to drink plenty of water, rest, and gradually resume normal daily activities in four to six weeks. A person can return to work or school in one to three months. If a person has not had any seizures in a year or more, the doctor may gradually reduce the medication dosage and eventually discontinue it. ## What Are the Results of Epilepsy Surgery? The outcomes of epilepsy surgery vary depending on the type of procedure carried out. Seizure control with medication is the expected result. The most common and well-understood procedure, temporal lobe resection, results in seizure-free outcomes for roughly two-thirds of people. According to studies, if a person takes seizure medication and does not have a seizure in the first year following temporal lobe surgery, the chances of being seizure-free at two years are 87 percent to 90 percent. If there are no seizures in the first two years, the chances of remaining seizure-free are 95 percent after five years and 82 percent after ten years. If there have been no seizures for the past year, the healthcare provider may reduce or discontinue the anti-seizure medication.

to 90 percent. If there are no seizures in the first two years, the chances of remaining seizure-free are 95 percent after five years and 82 percent after ten years. If there have been no seizures for the past year, the healthcare provider may reduce or discontinue the anti-seizure medication. **Conclusion** If one has epilepsy and medications have failed to control seizures, surgery may be an option. There are now numerous epilepsy surgeries available. The location of the seizures in the brain is important in determining which surgery is best. </content> </article> <article> <slug>usage-of-antiepileptic-agents-in-psychiatry</slug> <content>## What Is Seizure? A seizure is an abnormal synchronization and excessive excitation of a population of cortical neurons. ## What Is an Epilepsy? Epilepsy is a tendency towards repetitive seizures unprovoked by acute systemic or neurologic insults. ## What Are Antiepileptic Drugs? Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are one of the most common medications used to treat seizure disorders. Antiseizure or antiepileptic drugs are targeted to inhibit neurotransmission, which can be achieved by blocking sodium or calcium excitatory channels, enhancing the inhibitory activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), or by blocking glutamate receptors. The antiepileptic drug decreases the frequency and severity of seizures in people with epilepsy. It can treat the symptoms of seizures and not the underlying epileptic condition. The goal of therapy is to maximize the quality of life by minimizing seizures and adverse drug effects. The first effective AED (Antiepileptic drug) was potassium bromide, discovered in the mid-nineteenth century. Phenobarbital (PHB), which came into use

can treat the symptoms of seizures and not the underlying epileptic condition. The goal of therapy is to maximize the quality of life by minimizing seizures and adverse drug effects. The first effective AED (Antiepileptic drug) was potassium bromide, discovered in the mid-nineteenth century. Phenobarbital (PHB), which came into use in the early twentieth century, is used to induce sleep and was found to have antiseizure activity and became the drug of choice for many years. Several medications similar to Phenobarbital were developed, including Primidone. ## What Is the Pharmacokinetics of Antiepileptic Drugs? **Absorption of Antiepileptic Drugs:** * Absorption is essentially complete for all the Antiepileptic drugs except Gabapentin, which is dose-dependent. * The absorption timing varies widely by drug, formulation, and patient characteristics. * Absorption of AEDs is generally slowed by food in the stomach, except Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Lamotrigine, which are not slowed by food. * Therapeutic levels will usually take several hours. **Elimination of Antiepileptic Drugs:** * Metabolism generally occurs in the liver. * Excretion is done by the kidneys, both active and inactive metabolites. * Differences in metabolism - Age and systemic disease. ## How to Select an Antiepileptic Drug? The selection of Antiepileptic drugs is usually based on a range of factors, including: * Seizure type. * Age. * Gender (mainly if you are a woman living with epilepsy and of childbearing age). * General health. * How well a person can tolerate the medication. * Other associated health-related conditions. * Other medications. * The

It is a common misconception that only neurologists are entitled to prescribe anticonvulsants (antiepileptic agents). The field of psychiatry has utilized antiepileptics in treating a host of conditions, predominantly mood disorders. Anticonvulsants are also used to stabilize the mood of individuals with aggression, personality disorders, and bipolar affective disorder, previously called manic-depressive illness. Research has shown that some of the routinely used anticonvulsants show great promise in affective disorders. For example, we all know that Sodium Valproate is the first-line agent to treat seizures of all types, except focal seizures, for which Lamotrigine or Carbamazepine are the first-line agents. Surprisingly, all the three agents mentioned above are utilized to treat a host of neuropsychiatric conditions. **First-Generation AEDs:** * Carbamazepine. * Ethosuximide. * Phenobarbital. * Phenytoin. * Primidone. * Valproic acid or Sodium Valproate. **Newer Anticonvulsants:** * The newer anticonvulsants being tried in treating bipolar disorder include Gabapentin, Topiramate, Tiagabine, Felbamate, Eslicarbazepine Acetate, Lacosamide, Oxcarbazepine, Pregabalin, Rufinamide, Stiripentol, Tiagabine, Vigabatrin, and Zonisamide and Levetiracetam. * However, more large-scale studies are needed before we can routinely use these agents, in the same vein as one uses Sodium Valproate, Lamotrigine, or Carbamazepine. **Sodium

tried in treating bipolar disorder include Gabapentin, Topiramate, Tiagabine, Felbamate, Eslicarbazepine Acetate, Lacosamide, Oxcarbazepine, Pregabalin, Rufinamide, Stiripentol, Tiagabine, Vigabatrin, and Zonisamide and Levetiracetam. * However, more large-scale studies are needed before we can routinely use these agents, in the same vein as one uses Sodium Valproate, Lamotrigine, or Carbamazepine. **Sodium Valproate:** * Valproate is the drug of choice in dysphoric mania or irritable mania. * Mania is a phase in the course of a bipolar disorder patient. The individual is unusually cheerful and jocular, talks at a furious pace that cannot be interrupted, displays high energy levels, is irritable and restless, and has a decreased need for sleep. * Sodium Valproate or Valproic acid is the agent that is most commonly used in dysphoric mania. **Lamotrigine:** * Similarly, Lamotrigine is used when depressive spells or episodes predominate the illness (bipolar disorder). * It works wonders, provided it is initiated at a low dose and slowly titrated. * 'Start low, go slow' is a common dictum that one comes across, as far as the usage of Lamotrigine is concerned. * As much as it is a wonder drug, Lamotrigine can be the harbinger of a fatal skin rash, called the Steven-Johnson syndrome, if titrated rapidly. **Carbamazepine:** * Carbamazepine can be used to treat acute mania if the manic episode is refractory or recalcitrant to Lithium. * Some clinicians utilize Carbamazepine as a first-line agent also, in treating an acute manic episode. * Some studies have reported that several factors associated with

syndrome, if titrated rapidly. **Carbamazepine:** * Carbamazepine can be used to treat acute mania if the manic episode is refractory or recalcitrant to Lithium. * Some clinicians utilize Carbamazepine as a first-line agent also, in treating an acute manic episode. * Some studies have reported that several factors associated with non-response to Lithium might predict response to Carbamazepine. * These include dysphoric mania, greater severity of mania, a negative family history of bipolar disorder, and those with greater decrements in thyroxine levels during treatment. ## What Are the Uses of Antiepileptic Drugs? * Carbamazepine, Lamotrigine, Valproate, and Oxcarbazepine appear to have mood stabilizing properties. * Gabapentin, Tiagabine, and Pregabalin have anxiolytic benefits. * Pregabalin, Carbamazepine, Gabapentin, and Oxcarbazepine have been used to treat neuropathic pain like postherpetic neuralgia, and diabetic polyneuropathy. * Topiramate and Divalproex Sodium have been used in the prophylaxis or acute treatment of migraine. * Carbamazepine, Oxcarbazepine, Sodium Valproate are effective in acute mania. At the same time, Lamotrigine is effective in acute bipolar depression and prophylaxis but is ineffective in treating acute mania or preventing mania. * Levetiracetam is promising but needs studies on a larger scale. Topiramate and Gabapentin do not appear to provide benefits in treating core manic or depressive symptoms. Taking your AEDs as prescribed by your physician is essential for maintaining good seizure control. AEDs will work best when taken at the same time every day, and this will also help to keep the medication at a steady level in the body.

in treating core manic or depressive symptoms. Taking your AEDs as prescribed by your physician is essential for maintaining good seizure control. AEDs will work best when taken at the same time every day, and this will also help to keep the medication at a steady level in the body. Some reasons why people may not take their AEDs as prescribed by the physician include: * Forgetting to take a dose. * Accidental intake of two doses. * Stopping the medication due to side effects. * Reduced effect of the medication due to illness (for example, vomiting or diarrhea). * Using a different brand. * Running out of medication. * Stopping the medication without medical advice since the person has not had a seizure for a long time. **Conclusion:** The newer drugs have provided us with improved safety profiles and novel mechanisms of action. This vast choice of AEDs has made it desirable to offer tailored treatment plans based on the patient's unique profile. Even though there is an increase in the selection of medications, we can still only treat the symptoms of seizures. We cannot make any significant progress in reversing or stopping the underlying mechanism of epileptogenesis or offering neuroprotection from epileptogenesis. Therefore, it is not surprising that the prevalence of drug-resistant epilepsy has not improved despite the vast array of AED choices. </content> </article> <article> <slug>disorders-of-the-nerves</slug> <content>**Introduction:** Nerves are an essential part of the human body's communication system.

However, when nerves become damaged or dysfunctional, they can cause various disorders that can significantly impact a person's quality of life. ## **What Is Alzheimers Disease?** * Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that gradually affects a person's memory, cognitive function, and behavior. * Even though the precise etiology of Alzheimer's disease is still not entirely understood, it is thought that a number of environmental, genetic, and lifestyle variables may play a role in its onset. * The hallmark feature of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of abnormal protein deposits in the brain, known as beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles. **Symptoms:** * Memory loss. * Difficulty communicating. * Confusion. * Changes in mood and behavior. * People may struggle with basic self-care activities like dressing and bathing as the condition worsens. **Treatment:** * There is currently no treatment for Alzheimer's disease, and treatment options are focused on managing symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease. * Memantine and other cholinesterase inhibitors are two examples of drugs that may be administered to treat cognitive problems. * In addition, lifestyle modifications like regular exercise, a nutritious diet, and social interaction may

of Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy. People with Lafora progressive myoclonus epilepsy frequently have a variety of seizures. The entire body is affected by generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which result in tight muscles, convulsions, and loss of consciousness. Occipital seizures, which can result in temporary blindness and visual hallucinations, are another possibility for those affected. The seizures get worse with time and are harder to cure. Status epilepticus, a potentially fatal seizure disorder, may also appear. Status epilepticus is a prolonged period of unbroken seizure activity that lasts more than a few minutes. First identified in 1911, Lafora disease (LD) is an autosomal recessive progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME). It is especially prevalent in Mediterranean nations and some southern Indian regions with high consanguinity rates. Nonetheless, it can occur in any group and is more common, as would be expected, among families. LD typically begins in adolescence in otherwise neurologically healthy people and is characterized by tonic-clonic, absence, atonic, and visual seizures as well as action and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus. Also frequent are neuropsychiatric symptoms such as apathy, sadness, and behavioral abnormalities. Following the onset of symptoms, cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, mutism, fast progressive dementia, refractory status epilepticus, psychosis, and respiratory failure all contribute to death within ten years. ## What Are the Causes of Lafora Body Disease? The laforin dual specificity phosphatase and Malin ubiquitin E3 ligase, which are both involved in a complicated and still largely unrecognized process controlling glycogen metabolism, are the two genes responsible for LD.

death within ten years. ## What Are the Causes of Lafora Body Disease? The laforin dual specificity phosphatase and Malin ubiquitin E3 ligase, which are both involved in a complicated and still largely unrecognized process controlling glycogen metabolism, are the two genes responsible for LD. In a single family, a mutation in the PRDM8 gene has been documented to generate a form of early childhood onset phenotype. LD exhibits specific pathophysiology. Polyglucosans, which are deformed and insoluble glycogen molecules that differ from normal glycogen because they lack the symmetric branching that makes glycogen soluble, are seen in dense accumulations in cells of diverse sorts. The majority of neurons and all regions of the brain contain these polyglucosan accumulations, known as Lafora bodies (LBs). ## What Are the Clinical Features of Lafora Body Disease? The onset of LD symptoms usually occurs in late childhood or adolescence. Early indications of focal visual seizures typically include simple or complicated visual hallucinations and transitory blindness. Myoclonus and other generalized seizure types start soon after, such as tonic-clonic, absence, or drop episodes. The latter usually occurs at rest and rises in response to emotion, movement, or photic stimulus. The illness frequently manifests as a sneaky near- simultaneous occurrence, or closely successive, of headaches, academic difficulties, myoclonic jerks, generalized seizures, and visual hallucinations. It is noteworthy that not all visual hallucinations in Lafora patients are epileptic, as some of them initially respond to antipsychotic drugs rather than antiepileptic ones. ## How Is the Diagnosis of Lafora

near- simultaneous occurrence, or closely successive, of headaches, academic difficulties, myoclonic jerks, generalized seizures, and visual hallucinations. It is noteworthy that not all visual hallucinations in Lafora patients are epileptic, as some of them initially respond to antipsychotic drugs rather than antiepileptic ones. ## How Is the Diagnosis of Lafora Body Disease Done? Clinical symptoms frequently precede electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities, which initially consist of background activity that is practically normal or slowed and localized or generalized paroxysmal activity that is typically not increased by sleep. In particular, the occipital discharges on EEG, which result from a slower posterior dominant rhythm, are strongly symptomatic of the illness in the appropriate clinical situation. Within a few years, diffuse epileptic discharges frequently occur in superimposed bursts along with a slowdown of background activity. Furthermore, myoclonus, positive or negative, and strong photosensitivity are notable characteristics. Initially, brain MRI scans are typically unremarkable. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography identified posterior hypometabolism early in the course of the disease in two of the reported cases. Giant evoked potentials and improper integration of cortical hyperexcitability can be found through electrophysiological tests. Visual evoked potentials may exhibit longer latencies or no response at all. Further results from TMS point to a complex circuitry malfunction that may involve excitatory and inhibitory systems.

to a complex circuitry malfunction that may involve excitatory and inhibitory systems. A skin biopsy reveals the myoepithelial cells of the secretory acini of the apocrine sweat glands and the eccrine and apocrine sweat duct cells to have the distinctive periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive glycogen-like intracellular inclusion bodies. The existence of fibrillary accumulations, typical of polyglucosans, is confirmed by electron microscopy. This diagnostic method is low-invasive and highly sensitive. However, interpreting the biopsy requires skill in separating LB from the typical polysaccharide contents of apocrine sweat glands; otherwise, false-positive diagnoses are frequently made. ## What Is the Prognosis of Lafora Body Disease Done? The prognosis of LD is generally catastrophic and progressive, with mortality occurring 5â€“10 years following the onset of clinical symptoms. Patients with EPM2A and EPM2B mutations do not significantly differ based on genotype- phenotype correlations. Still, some specific EPM2B mutations seem to be associated with late-onset and slow progression of LD. The best available medications for LD currently have modest success in symptom regulation; hence palliative care is still the mainstay of care. In the early stages of the disease, myoclonus symptoms may be alleviated by commonly used antiepileptic medication. ## What Is the Management of Lafora Body Disease Done? There is little doubt that the health systems of different nations differ significantly, especially between industrialized and underdeveloped cultures. Moreover, health coverage is unique in many industrialized nations, so some patients may benefit from a wide selection of options while others do not. It is also evident that

Disease Done? There is little doubt that the health systems of different nations differ significantly, especially between industrialized and underdeveloped cultures. Moreover, health coverage is unique in many industrialized nations, so some patients may benefit from a wide selection of options while others do not. It is also evident that people with LD should receive the most assistance feasible from the current healthcare system. Although LD is an uncommon disorder that cannot be categorized as a public health issue, it significantly affects patients and carers, and society should unite and offer all possible assistance. No specific antimyoclonic drugs are effective against LD to stop seizures and myoclonus, and the effect lasts the entire duration of the illness. Sadly, they only have a minor impact and have little bearing on how cognitive and behavioral symptoms develop. Patients usually get an AED, commonly valproic acid, after the first generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS). This typically works well in temporarily suppressing the majority of GTCS, photic sensitivity symptoms, and some myoclonus. Despite the apparent clinical remission, the EEG reveals two peculiar effects that should prompt an early diagnosis of LD: first, the patients experience negative myoclonus, which becomes more noticeable before the more typical myoclonic jerks, and second, the EEG reveals rapidly increasing, permanent interictal changes, including focal occipital spikes. **Conclusion** The current possibilities for patients with lafora disease involve a sensible, successful approach to diagnosis and the rational use of all available instruments to support the patients and their families.

Anyone can develop epilepsy; males and females are both affected equally. Ohtahara syndrome is one of the rare types of epilepsy that begins during the infancy stage. Children with this condition experience seizures as well as developmental problems. ## What Is Ohtahara Syndrome? Ohtahara syndrome is one among a group of developmental epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), a rare epilepsy syndrome primarily seen in infants. Ohtahara syndrome is also known as early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) or early infantile epileptic encephalopathy with burst suppression pattern (EIEE-BS). Children with this syndrome start to have seizures early in the first few weeks or months of life (mainly before three years). These seizures are hard to control and cause developmental delays. ## What Are the Causes of Ohtahara Syndrome? Ohrahara syndrome can occur due to various causes, such as: * **Brain Malformations** \- Ohtahara syndrome occurs primarily due to abnormal brain development. The abnormalities include: 1. **Diffuse** \-

before three years). These seizures are hard to control and cause developmental delays. ## What Are the Causes of Ohtahara Syndrome? Ohrahara syndrome can occur due to various causes, such as: * **Brain Malformations** \- Ohtahara syndrome occurs primarily due to abnormal brain development. The abnormalities include: 1. **Diffuse** \- Most common, affecting both sides of the brain. 2. **Focal** \- Less common, affecting only one area of the brain. * **Genetic Mutations** \- Genetic mutation is another reason causing Ohtahara syndrome due to abnormal development or function of the brain. * **Metabolic Disorders** \- Metabolic disorders can lead to Ohtahara syndrome as they impact the usage of energy by the body and brain, resulting in abnormal brain function and seizures. * **Idiopathic Cases** \- These are those cases in which no apparent cause of Ohtahara syndrome is found, even after conducting multiple tests and examinations. ## What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Ohtahara? Children with Ohtahara syndrome show two primary symptoms: * Seizures. * Developmental delays. 1. **Seizures** - * **Timing** \- Children with Ohtahara syndrome develop seizures within the first three months of their life. Usually, the symptoms appear within the first two weeks after birth. * **The Severity of Seizures** \- These seizures are difficult to control and often require treatment with the help of antiseizure medications. * **Types of seizures involved** \- Ohtahara syndrome is associated with many different types of seizures. An EEG (electroencephalogram) or long-term video EEG (electroencephalogram) monitoring is often helpful to:

**The Severity of Seizures** \- These seizures are difficult to control and often require treatment with the help of antiseizure medications. * **Types of seizures involved** \- Ohtahara syndrome is associated with many different types of seizures. An EEG (electroencephalogram) or long-term video EEG (electroencephalogram) monitoring is often helpful to: * Identify all the types of seizures taking place in this syndrome. * Identify the frequency of the seizures. * Decide if an episode is a seizure or not. The most common seizure in this syndrome is tonic, also known as tonic spasms, which usually last for a few seconds. The tonic seizure involves the following signs such as: * Stiffening of arms and legs. * It can affect one or both sides of the body. * It can occur when a baby is awake or asleep. Other types of seizures that can occur in Ohtahara syndrome include: 1. **Focal Seizure** \- Focal seizures only affect a specific part of the brain and cause abnormal movement in that part. 2. **Atonic Seizures** \- This type of seizure causes the sudden loss of muscle tone in children and is also known as drop attacks. 3. **Myoclonic Seizures** \- This involves shock-like jerks of the muscle or group of muscles. 4. **Generalized Tonic-Clonic or Grand Mal Seizures** \- Affect both halves of the brain and cause sudden loss of alertness followed by muscle stiffness and jerking movements. 5. **Infantile Spasms:** This involves sudden neck, arms, or leg movements that may last for

jerks of the muscle or group of muscles. 4. **Generalized Tonic-Clonic or Grand Mal Seizures** \- Affect both halves of the brain and cause sudden loss of alertness followed by muscle stiffness and jerking movements. 5. **Infantile Spasms:** This involves sudden neck, arms, or leg movements that may last for only one second. 2\. **Developmental Delays -** Some developmental delays related to this syndrome can result from the underlying condition in combination with ongoing seizures. The infants affected with this syndrome do not reach the exact growth milestone compared to the other infants of the same age. Some of the signs or symptoms seen in these infants are as follows: * Less active or less alert. * Prone to low muscle tone (hypotonia). * Developmental symptoms may be present before seizures start. However, they can worsen as the seizures increase. ## How Is This Syndrome Diagnosed? Ohtahara syndrome can be diagnosed by considering multiple factors such as a history of seizures and developmental problems in children, physical examination, EEG (electroencephalogram), and other brain imaging tests. * **Physical Examination:** Examining young infants can be challenging; only specialists can review their physical condition. Children in this condition can have somewhat stiff or floppy muscles. They also have abnormal reflexes and might not be able to follow the moving object with their eyes. * **Diagnostic Tests:** Several diagnostic tests that may be used in Ohtahara syndrome include: 1. **Electroencephalogram (EEG)** \- An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a non-invasive test that determines brain wave activity.

floppy muscles. They also have abnormal reflexes and might not be able to follow the moving object with their eyes. * **Diagnostic Tests:** Several diagnostic tests that may be used in Ohtahara syndrome include: 1. **Electroencephalogram (EEG)** \- An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a non-invasive test that determines brain wave activity. In this test, metal discs are placed on the scalp of a child, which detect brain wave activity on a computer screen. The EEG pattern in Ohtahara syndrome is seen as a burst suppression pattern. 2. **Brain Imaging Tests -** These tests involve magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), which create images of the structure of the brain. The underdeveloped areas of the brain or altered brain structure can be accessed in these imaging tests. ****Other Laboratory Tests:** ** Along with the above-mentioned tests, some of the additional tests can also be advised by the doctor, such as: * **Genetic Tests:** Three common types of genetic tests that help diagnose Ohtahara syndrome are : * **Chromosomal Microarrays** \- A technology used for the detection of clinically-significant microdeletions or duplications, with high sensitivity for submicroscopic aberrations. * **Epilepsy Genetic Panels** \- This test involves the analysis of the most common genes associated with epilepsy. * **Whole Exome Sequencing** \- A type of genetic sequencing used to understand the symptoms and cause of the disease. ## What Is the Treatment for Ohtahara Syndrome?

common genes associated with epilepsy. * **Whole Exome Sequencing** \- A type of genetic sequencing used to understand the symptoms and cause of the disease. ## What Is the Treatment for Ohtahara Syndrome? There are several treatment options available to manage Ohtahara syndrome. The treatment can help reduce the frequency and severity of the seizures, but they are ineffective in managing developmental conditions. Some of the treatment options include: 1. **Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AED)** \- Some of the medicine used for the treatment of epilepsy are Topamax (Topiramate), Zonegran (Zonisamide), Sabril (Vigabatrin), Felbatol (Felbamate), and others. The medicine can be given as an injection or in liquid form as the babies will not be able to swallow it. 2. **Steroid Treatment** \- The high-dose steroids such as Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) or Methylprednisolone can also be used to treat Ohtahara syndrome. 3. **Ketogenic Diet** \- This diet is high in fats and low in protein and carbohydrates. It helps in the prevention of seizures through a metabolic process called ketosis. 4. **Transcranial Stimulation** \- Another technique known as high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) is used to administer electrical stimulation to the brain using electrodes. 5. **Epilepsy Surgery** \- In some cases, epilepsy can be treated with surgery which involves removing the affected part of the brain to prevent the spread of chaotic nerve activity. 6. **Physical and Cognitive Therapy** \- In mild cases of Ohtahara syndrome, the therapy can help maximize their ability to walk, talk, learn, and interact with others.

And in some cases, even after treatment, the patient may have seizures throughout their lifetime. This grave condition requires proper diagnosis and critical care for the affected child. </content> </article> <article> <slug>lamotrigine</slug> <content>**Overview:** Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic drug, also known as an anticonvulsant. It belongs to the phenyltriazine class. It is used in the treatment of seizures as well as acts as a mood pacifier in people with bipolar disorder. It is the first medication since Lithium that has been granted Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for managing bipolar disorder type I. **Important Warning:** Lamotrigine might cause a life-threatening skin rash in individuals starting with a very high dose.

might cause a life-threatening skin rash in individuals starting with a very high dose. Immediate emergency attention is required in case one develops a skin rash, hives, blisters, peeling, mouth sores, or sores around the mouth. ## How Does Lamotrigine Work? Lamotrigine belongs to a class of anticonvulsants or antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). These drugs are used to treat the same kind of conditions. For example, in epileptic patients, Lamotrigine reduces the release of a substance known as glutamate in the brain, thus preventing the brain neurons from becoming very active. This results in lesser seizures. In people with bipolar disorder, Lamotrigine might affect some receptors in the brain that control one's mood, decreasing the number of mood swings. **Uses of Lamotrigine:** Lamotrigine is indicated in the following - * **Epilepsy -** Lamotrigine is used as adjunctive therapy for specific seizure types in patients two years and above. Seizures such as partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures, and generalized seizures of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Lamotrigine is used for the conversion to monotherapy in adults with partial-onset seizures who are undergoing treatment with Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Primidone, or Valproate. * **Bipolar Disorder -** Lamotrigine is used for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder type I to delay the frequency of mood changes such as depression, mania, hypomania, etc. However, the efficacy of Lamotrigine in the treatment of acute mood disorders has not been found. **Limitations:** Lamotrigine should not be used in treating acute mood disorders, as its efficiency has not been confirmed.

The baby might need careful monitoring for a few days after birth. * **Breastfeeding -** One can take Lamotrigine while breastfeeding if the baby is healthy. The dose of the drug can be reduced after delivery. Do not stop Lamotrigine without the doctor's consent. Lamotrigine can pass in breast milk in different amounts. If the baby shows signs of drowsiness, skin rash, poor feeding, and flabby muscles, they should be taken to the hospital as soon as possible. * **Children -** Lamotrigine is indicated in kids above two years of age for partial onset seizures, generalized seizures of Lennox-gastaut syndrome, and primary generalized tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures. * **Elderly -** The dose selection of an elderly patient should be careful, starting with the lower dosage. **Warnings and Contraindications:** Lamotrigine is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity such as rash, angioedema (sudden swelling of a body part), acute urticaria (itchy rash on the skin), extensive pruritus (itching), mucosal ulceration to the drug or any of its constituents. **Warnings and Precautions:** * **Severe Skin Rashes -** In kids aged two to 16 and adults, painful, life-threatening rashes have been reported. Furthermore, including Valproate in a multidrug regimen has increased the risk of severe, life-threatening inflammation in children and adults. The risk of developing skin rashes increases by increasing the recommended dosage for individuals allergic to other antiepileptic drugs. * **Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions and Organ Failure -** Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, also known as drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have been found to

The risk of developing skin rashes increases by increasing the recommended dosage for individuals allergic to other antiepileptic drugs. * **Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions and Organ Failure -** Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions, also known as drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), have been found to occur with Lamotrigine. It usually presents with fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy in patients with hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis (inflammation of the heart), or myositis, resembling acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is also present. * **Blood Dyscrasias -** Blood dyscrasias such as neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia (less platelets), pancytopenia (less red blood cells), aplastic anemia, and red cell aplasia have seldom been found associated with DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms). * **Suicidal Behavior -** Lamotrigine has been found to increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. * **Bipolar Disorder -** The effectiveness of Lamotrigine in treating acute bipolar disorder has not been established. In addition, the safety and efficacy of Lamotrigine in children less than 18 years of age with bipolar disorder have not been found. Patients with a history of suicidal behavior and young adults are at an increased risk and require extensive monitoring during treatment. * **Aseptic Meningitis -** Lamotrigine increases the risk of developing aseptic meningitis. * **Use With Oral Contraceptives -** Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives have been found to reduce the serum concentration of Lamotrigine. Therefore, dosage adjustment is needed in such cases. * **Withdrawal Seizures -** In patients with epilepsy, there is an

Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) has been reported in certain patients. Lamotrigine tends to bind to the eye and other melanin-containing tissues. **For Patients:** ## What Is a Seizure? A seizure is a sudden, uncontrolled disturbance in the brain. It can cause changed behavior, movements, and levels of consciousness. Two or more seizures around twenty-four hours apart that are not due to an identifiable cause are known as epilepsy. ## Why Is Lamotrigine Prescribed for Seizure? Lamotrigine is used with other medications to treat certain kinds of seizures in patients with epilepsy. All Lamotrigine tablets, apart from the extended- release tablets, are used alone or with other medicines to treat seizures in people with epilepsy. The various Lamotrigine tablets, except for the extended-release tablets, also increase the duration between the multiple episodes of mood disorders in people with bipolar disorder. Lamotrigine falls under a class of medications known as anticonvulsants. It reduces unusual, abnormal electrical activity in the brain. ## How to Take Lamotrigine? * Lamotrigine is available as a tablet, an extended-release tablet, an orally disintegrating tablet, and a chewable dispersible tablet that is taken orally with or

Description - Lamotrigine is a member of the phenyltriazine class of drugs. The chemical name is 3,5- diamino-6-(2,3-chlorophenyl)-as-triazine. The molecular formula is C9H7N5Cl2, and the molecular weight is 256.09. It is a pale white to cream-colored powder and is slightly soluble in water and 0.1 M of HCL. **Components:** **1\. Active Ingredients -** Lamotrigine. **2\. Inactive Ingredients -** * Lactose. * Magnesium stearate. * Microcrystalline cellulose. * Povidone. * Sodium starch glycolate. * FD&C yellow no. 6 lake (100 mg tablet only). * Ferric oxide yellow (150 mg tablet only). * FD&C blue no. 2 lake (200 mg tablet only). **Clinical Pharmacology:** **Mechanism of Action -** The exact mechanism by which Lamotrigine deploys its anticonvulsant action is not known. Lamotrigine is effective in preventing the spread of seizures in the maximum electroshock (MES) and pentylenetetrazol (scMet) tests and also stopped seizures in the visually and electrically evoked after-discharge (EEAD) tests for the antiepileptic activity. An effect on sodium channels is also one of the mechanisms of action of Lamotrigine. Some studies also suggest that Lamotrigine inhibits the voltage-sensitive sodium channels, thus stabilizing neuronal membranes, and modulates presynaptic transmitter release of excitatory amino acids. **Pharmacodynamics:** * **Folate Metabolism -** Lamotrigine inhibits dihydrofolate reductase,

Some studies also suggest that Lamotrigine inhibits the voltage-sensitive sodium channels, thus stabilizing neuronal membranes, and modulates presynaptic transmitter release of excitatory amino acids. **Pharmacodynamics:** * **Folate Metabolism -** Lamotrigine inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, which might interfere with the biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins. * **Accumulation in the kidneys -** Lamotrigine accumulates in the kidneys causing chronic progressive nephrosis, necrosis, and mineralization. * **Melanin Binding -** Lamotrigine binds to melanin-containing tissues, such as the eyes and pigmented skin. * **Cardiovascular -** Lamotrigine is assimilated to a 2-N-methyl metabolite. This metabolite causes an increase in the dose-dependent PR interval, widening the QRS complex and complete AV conduction block in higher doses. **Pharmacokinetics:** * **Mean Cmax -** Cmax is In the range of 1.4 to 4.8 hours post-dose. * **Median Tmax-** 1.3 hours post-dose. [**Cmax-** Maximum concentration achieved by a drug in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or target organ after administration of a dose] [**Tmax-** Time taken for a drug to reach maximum concentration after administration of a dose] **Pharmacokinetic Changes -** Lamotrigine is well absorbed, with bioavailability reaching around 100 %. The absorption remains unaffected by food, and there is no first-pass metabolism. **A.

Elimination -** Total body clearance is 0.4 to 1.1 mL/min/kg. **Special Considerations:** * **Pregnancy -** The physiological changes during pregnancy might affect Lamotrigine concentrations or therapeutic effects. There have been reduced Lamotrigine concentrations during pregnancy and restoration of the pre-partum concentration after the delivery. Dose adjustment is recommended to maintain the clinical response. * **Labor and Delivery -** Lamotrigine's effect on labor and delivery remains unknown. * **Nursing Mothers -** Lamotrigine is present in the milk. The Lamotrigine plasma levels in breastfed infants are as high as 50 % of the mother's serum levels. Therefore, breastfeeding should be discontinued in infants with Lamotrigine toxicity. * **Pediatric Use -** Lamotrigine is indicated in kids above two years of age for partial onset seizures, generalized seizures of Lennox-gastaut syndrome, and PGTC seizures. * **Geriatric Use -** The dose selection of an elderly patient should be made carefully, starting

- A multicenter, double-blind clinical trial with 156 patients having partial seizures has been performed. The patients experienced around four simple partial-onset, complex partial-onset, and secondarily generalized seizures in four weeks of receiving Carbamazepine or Phenytoin monotherapy. **Trial Endpoints -** The trial endpoints were the completion of trial treatment or meeting escape criteria: * Doubling the monthly count of seizures. * Doubling of the highest 2-day frequency of seizure. * A new type of seizure. * Prolongation of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The primary efficiency was the percentage of patients who met the escape criteria. **Results -** Around 42 % of the patients receiving Lamotrigine met the escape criteria, and 69 % were in the valproate group. The difference in the patients meeting escape criteria was in favor of Lamotrigine. No differences in efficiency based on age, sex, or race were found. **Patient Counseling Information:** The patient should be advised to read the FDA-approved patient labeling. * **Rash -** Before starting with Lamotrigine, the patient should be informed about the inflammation and other signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity. * **Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions -** The patients should be informed about multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions and acute multiorgan failure that might occur with Lamotrigine. * **Suicidal Thinking and Behaviour -** The patients and their caretakers should be informed that Lamotrigine might increase suicidal thoughts. They should be instructed to be vigilant of any unusual changes in behavior. * **Worsening of the Seizures -** The patients should be asked to report to a doctor in

* Unusual bleeding. * Missed periods. </content> </article> <article> <slug>emergency-management-of-refractory-seizures</slug> <content>**Introduction:** Epilepsy is a condition where people can have sudden, abnormal brain activity that causes seizures. These seizures can be very short or last a few minutes. Some individuals with epilepsy may experience what is called "refractory epilepsy," which means that regular medicines do not work well or not at all in controlling their seizures. Depending on the type of seizures a person has, their treatment approach may vary. There are two main types: * Generalized seizures (affecting both sides of the brain). * Focal seizures (starting in a more minor part of the brain and potentially spreading). Refractory epilepsy can significantly impact a person's life, causing difficulties at work or school, constant worry about when the subsequent seizure might occur, and even injuries due to the seizures. If a healthcare provider suspects someone of refractory epilepsy, they may recommend visiting a specialized medical center for epilepsy care. ## **What Are the Causes and Symptoms of Refractory Seizure?** **Causes:** 1. Some seizures result from known causes like head injuries, infections, fevers, or brain tumors. 2. However, the cause of seizures in epilepsy is often unknown. 3. It is also unclear why some people with epilepsy do not find relief from anti-epilepsy medications. 4. Sometimes, these medications stop being effective, possibly due to extremely high brain activity during seizures. 5. The exact reasons behind these phenomena remain a mystery. **Symptoms:** * Shaking or convulsions. * Passing out. * Confusion. * Tongue

why some people with epilepsy do not find relief from anti-epilepsy medications. 4. Sometimes, these medications stop being effective, possibly due to extremely high brain activity during seizures. 5. The exact reasons behind these phenomena remain a mystery. **Symptoms:** * Shaking or convulsions. * Passing out. * Confusion. * Tongue biting. * Lip smacking. * Uncontrolled eye movements. * Odd behavior like screaming and yelling. * Losing control of bowels or bladder. * Staring blankly. * Falling down. * Muscles getting very stiff. If a person has seizures while on epilepsy medications, they might have refractory epilepsy. ## **What Are the Alternative and Potential Future Treatments for Epilepsy?** 1. **Alternative Therapies:** Some alternative treatments, like herbal remedies or traditional practices such as ayurvedic medicine, are being studied to see if they can help manage epilepsy. Behavioral therapies are also considered, like identifying and avoiding seizure triggers or using relaxation techniques like meditation. 2. **Current Medications:** Although there are more epilepsy drugs available today, many patients still do not respond well to them. Newer drugs are designed based on understanding how epilepsy works in the brain, but they do not always work as expected. Some have fewer side effects but work similarly to older medications. 3. **Research Focus:** Researchers are trying to find better treatments and ways to prevent epilepsy from developing in the first place (antiepileptogenesis). They believe finding reliable markers (biomarkers) for epilepsy could be a critical step. These markers could help identify people at high risk for epilepsy,

They believe finding reliable markers (biomarkers) for epilepsy could be a critical step. These markers could help identify people at high risk for epilepsy, assess the progression of the disease, and guide treatment decisions. 4. **Biomarkers:**Biomarkers are like signals showing if epilepsy is developing or if someone has a high risk of seizures. These markers would make clinical trials for new treatments more efficient and less expensive. They could also help diagnose epilepsy faster, potentially even after a single seizure, and tailor drug treatment to each person's needs without trial and error. 5. **Surgical Guidance:** Biomarkers could also help pinpoint the exact area in the brain where seizures originate, making it easier to plan and carry out surgical procedures to remove the problematic brain tissue. 6. **Future Research:** While some biomarkers currently require invasive procedures to detect, future research may make it possible to identify them through non-invasive methods like scalp EEG (electroencephalogram) or brain imaging. ## **What Is the Emergency Supportive Treatment That Is Done for Epilepsy Patients?** When someone arrives at the emergency room while still having a seizure, they need immediate basic care. 1. **Airway and Breathing:** Seizures can sometimes make it hard for a person to breathe, and low oxygen levels can worsen the seizure. So, first, the person's head and neck should be positioned to keep their airway open.

emergency room while still having a seizure, they need immediate basic care. 1. **Airway and Breathing:** Seizures can sometimes make it hard for a person to breathe, and low oxygen levels can worsen the seizure. So, first, the person's head and neck should be positioned to keep their airway open. If needed, any blockages should be removed. Oxygen can be given through a mask or small tubes in the nose. If breathing remains problematic, a tube may be placed in the windpipe (trachea) to help breathing. But, the most important thing is to stop the seizure with medication, which makes managing breathing much easier afterward. 2. **Glucose Levels:** Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) is an uncommon cause of prolonged seizures in children, but checking blood sugar levels is important. A sugar solution is given through a vein if the blood sugar is too low. 3. **Blood Pressure:** Low blood pressure can make the situation worse. So, it is essential to keep the blood pressure at normal levels. If there is no sign of severe shock, a small amount of fluids is given through a vein to help maintain blood pressure. ## **Are There Any Medications That Can Be Used Successfully in Emergency Rooms to Stop Seizures?** **Treatment Before Reaching the Hospital:** 1. **Diazepam for Seizures** : Diazepam is commonly used to stop seizures. It works well but can have breathing problems as a side effect, so it is usually given after arriving at the hospital, except for known cases. 2. **Prehospital

It works well but can have breathing problems as a side effect, so it is usually given after arriving at the hospital, except for known cases. 2. **Prehospital Use of Diazepam:** Some studies suggest that using Diazepam before reaching the hospital can be effective and safe. A study found that giving Diazepam before arriving at the hospital reduced seizure duration and the chances of having more seizures. 3. **Safety of Rectal Diazepam:** Administering Diazepam through the rectum (bottom) is generally safe and rarely causes breathing problems in children. **First Hospital Treatment:** 1. **Seizures in Hospital:** If a child is still having a seizure when they arrive at the hospital, they will need immediate treatment because their seizure has likely lasted at least 10 minutes. 2. **Effectiveness of Diazepam:** One dose of rectal Diazepam is usually effective in controlling seizures, and there is often no need for more unless the first dose does not work or if the child has another seizure. 3. **Alternative Medications:** Other medications like Phenobarbitone, Phenytoin, and Lorazepam can also be used instead of Diazepam. Lorazepam is effective and has a longer-lasting effect than Diazepam, making it a good choice for some cases. ## **Why Refractory Seizures Are Challenging to Treat?** **Difficult-to-Treat Seizures (Refractory Seizures):** 1. **Defining Refractory Seizures:** Refractory seizures do not respond to standard treatment with one or more anticonvulsant drugs. 2. **Traditional

High doses of Phenobarbitone are another option. 3. **Midazolam as an Alternative:** Midazolam is a newer option for difficult-to-treat seizures. It works quickly, can be given continuously, and has fewer drawbacks than other drugs. It is especially useful when other medications have failed. 4. **Midazolam Effectiveness:** Midazolam has shown promise in controlling seizures even when other drugs have not worked. It might be considered earlier in treatment to avoid prolonged seizures. 5. **Use of Midazolam in the ER:** In emergency rooms, intravenous and intramuscular Midazolam have been used effectively and safely to stop seizures. ## **How Surgical Techniques Improved the Accuracy and Effectiveness of Epilepsy Surgery?** 1. **Who Benefits:** Brain surgery is an option for people with refractory epilepsy, especially if their seizures originate from one specific area in the brain that is not critical for essential functions. 2. **Advancements:** Advances in imaging and surgical techniques allow for more precise identification and removal of the seizure's source (seizure focus). 3. **Outcomes:** Epilepsy surgery can lead to seizure freedom or significantly reduced seizure frequency for carefully selected patients. **Types

It can result in seizure freedom for 48 % to 84 % of patients. 2. **Palliative Procedure:** This surgery prevents seizure progression by interrupting nerve pathways. Corpus callosotomy, which disconnects the brain's two hemispheres, can reduce generalized tonic-clonic seizures by 80 % and other seizures by 50 %. **Other Treatment Options:** 1. **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS):** VNS is a non-medication therapy for refractory partial seizures. It involves implanting a device connected to the vagus nerve under the skin. It helps reduce seizures in about 37 % of patients, with rare cases of complete seizure freedom. 2. **Ketogenic Diet:** This diet, high in fat and low in carbs, has effectively treated refractory epilepsy. It may work by reducing neural excitability. However, it has potential complications like metabolic issues and should be carefully considered. **Conclusion:** Follow the doctor's instructions precisely when taking the anti-epilepsy medications. Properly using these medications can improve their effectiveness in managing the condition. There is also a special diet known as a ketogenic diet that might help in controlling the seizures.

Epilepsy is a common neurological disease in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing unprovoked, recurrent seizures. A seizure is a sudden disturbance of electrical activity in the brain. There are two primary types of seizures, which are: * **Generalized Seizures** \- These affect the entire brain. * **Focal Seizures** \- These types of seizures affect just one part of the brain. It might be difficult to recognize a mild seizure. It can last a couple of moments, during which you lose consciousness. Stronger seizures can cause fits and uncontrollable muscle twitches and can last a couple of moments to a few minutes. Some people lose consciousness during a stronger seizure. However, most people do not have any memory of it occurring. ## What Causes Epilepsy? Epilepsy is not contagious. Although numerous underlying disease mechanisms can result in epilepsy, it still has no identifiable cause in about 50 % of all cases. In the other half, epilepsy may be traced to various factors,

Although numerous underlying disease mechanisms can result in epilepsy, it still has no identifiable cause in about 50 % of all cases. In the other half, epilepsy may be traced to various factors, such as: * High fever. * Very low blood sugar. * Alcohol withdrawal. * A severe head injury. * Prenatal injury. * Infections. * Congenital abnormalities or genetic conditions. * Stroke. ## Who Can Get Epilepsy? Epilepsy is a common neurological issue that affects 65 million people far and wide. Anybody can develop epilepsy, but it is more common in young children and older adults. Men are more likely to get epilepsy than women. In addition, children and adolescents are more prone to develop epilepsy of unknown or genetic origin. ## What Are the Symptoms of Epilepsy? Because epilepsy is mainly caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process the brain coordinates. The signs and symptoms of seizures may include: * Temporary confusion. * Stiff muscles. * A staring spell. * Loss of consciousness or awareness. * Uncontrollable jerk of the arms and legs. * Psychological symptoms like fear, anxiety, or deja vu. However, symptoms differ from individual to individual and per the type of seizure. Doctors generally categorize seizures as either focal or generalized, depending on where and how the abnormal brain activity starts. * **Focal (partial) Seizures** \- A basic partial seizure does not

symptoms like fear, anxiety, or deja vu. However, symptoms differ from individual to individual and per the type of seizure. Doctors generally categorize seizures as either focal or generalized, depending on where and how the abnormal brain activity starts. * **Focal (partial) Seizures** \- A basic partial seizure does not include a loss of consciousness. The symptoms include: * Alterations of taste, smell, sight, hearing, or touch. * Dizziness. * Tingling and twitching of limbs. * Focal seizure symptoms may be confused with other neurological disorders, like migraine, narcolepsy, or mental illness. Therefore, a detailed examination and testing are required to differentiate epilepsy from other conditions. * **Complex Partial Seizures** \- These include loss of consciousness along with: * Staring blankly. * Lethargy. * Performing repetitive movements. ## How Is Epilepsy Diagnosed? The doctor may suggest some diagnostic tests depending on the medical history and symptoms. For example, the doctor may order several tests to diagnose epilepsy and discover the cause of seizures. The evaluation may include: * **Neurological Examination:** The doctor may test the individual's behavior, mental function, motor abilities, and other areas to diagnose the medical condition and determine the type of epilepsy one may have. * **Blood Tests:** The doctor may consider taking a blood sample to check for signs of infections, genetic conditions, or other conditions associated with seizures. The doctor may suggest tests to detect brain abnormalities, such as: * **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** This is the most common test to diagnose epilepsy. It is a noninvasive,

Tests:** The doctor may consider taking a blood sample to check for signs of infections, genetic conditions, or other conditions associated with seizures. The doctor may suggest tests to detect brain abnormalities, such as: * **EEG (Electroencephalogram):** This is the most common test to diagnose epilepsy. It is a noninvasive, painless test in which electrodes are attached to the scalp using a paste-like substance or cap. These electrodes record the brain's electrical activity. If someone has epilepsy, there will be changes in the normal pattern of brain waves, even when not having a seizure. Some imaging tests can uncover tumors and other abnormalities that can cause seizures. These tests may include: * Computed tomography (CT) scan. * Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). * Positron emission tomography (PET). * Single-photon discharge computerized tomography. ## How Is Epilepsy Treated? Most people can manage epilepsy. The treatment plan is based on the severity of symptoms, your health, and how well you react to the therapy. Some treatment options include: **Medications:** * **Antiepileptic Drugs:** These medications can reduce your number of seizures. In some people, they help eliminate seizures. For the medications to be effective, take them as prescribed by the doctor. Many children with epilepsy who experience epilepsy symptoms can eventually quit medications and live a seizure-free life. Many adults can discontinue medications after two or more years without seizures. The doctor may advise about the right time to stop taking medications. More than 20 different types of antiepileptic medications are available. The medication

epilepsy who experience epilepsy symptoms can eventually quit medications and live a seizure-free life. Many adults can discontinue medications after two or more years without seizures. The doctor may advise about the right time to stop taking medications. More than 20 different types of antiepileptic medications are available. The medication the doctor chooses to treat epilepsy depends on the type of seizures one has and other factors like age and other health conditions. However, these medications may have some side effects, including fatigue, dizziness, weight gain, loss of bone density, skin rashes, loss of coordination, and speech problems. * **Other Therapies:** Apart from medications and surgery, there are a few potential therapies that can be an alternative for treating epilepsy: * **Vagus Nerve Stimulator:** In this, a battery-powered device called a vagus nerve stimulator is implanted underneath the skin of the chest. This device transmits bursts of electrical energy through the vagus nerve and to the brain. It is unclear how this device inhibits seizures, but it can reduce seizures by 20 % to 40 %. * **Ketogenic Diet:** In a ketogenic diet, the body breaks down fats instead of carbohydrates for energy. Studies suggested some children with epilepsy have been able to reduce their seizures by following a ketogenic diet. * **Deep Brain Stimulation:** It is often recommended for people whose seizures do not get better with medication. In this treatment, surgeons implant electrodes into a specific part of the brain (thalamus). The electrodes are connected to a generator

In this treatment, surgeons implant electrodes into a specific part of the brain (thalamus). The electrodes are connected to a generator implanted underneath the chest. This generator transmits electrical pulses to the brain at timed intervals and may reduce seizures. **Surgery:** If medication cannot reduce the number of seizures, brain surgery is another option. Surgery may be helpful to people who respond poorly to drug treatments. ## How Can Epilepsy Be Prevented? About 25 % of epilepsy cases are preventable. The following things can be helpful: * Preventing trauma or head injury is the best way to prevent post-traumatic epilepsy. * Using medications and other methods to lower the body temperature of a feverish child can lessen the chance of febrile seizures. * Adequate perinatal care can decrease new epilepsy cases caused by birth injury. * Epilepsy associated with stroke is focused on reducing cardiovascular risk factors, e.g., steps to control high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, and avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol use. * Central nervous system infections are common reasons for epilepsy in tropical areas. Therefore, eliminating parasites in these environments and educating on avoiding infections can effectively reduce epilepsy worldwide, such as cases due to neurocysticercosis. **Conclusion:** Epilepsy is a chronic condition that can negatively affect many parts of life.

Treatment includes medications or surgery that can control seizures for most people with epilepsy. Understanding the condition can help one take better control of it. </content> </article> <article> <slug>pediatric-epilepsy-surgery</slug> <content>**Introduction** Epilepsy is a neurological disorder causing recurrent and unpredictable seizures that can be challenging for a person's daily life and cause various risks to their health and well-being. Epilepsy can affect individuals of all ages; however, for children and their families, it is very difficult to handle. Pediatric epilepsy surgery can be performed to treat a selected group of pediatric patients whose seizures are not controllable by medications. The appropriate individual selected for pediatric epilepsy surgery should meet several criteria. In patients who meet the requirements for epilepsy surgery, the results can be very positive, with very few side effects and complications. ## What Is Epilepsy? Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects the brain's electrical activity, causing recurrent seizures. Seizures manifest as brief, subtle episodes or prolonged, convulsive events. It can vary in type and severity. Seizure episodes can occur due to excessive electrical discharges in a group of brain cells.

Chunk 198:
## What Is Epilepsy? Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects the brain's electrical activity, causing recurrent seizures. Seizures manifest as brief, subtle episodes or prolonged, convulsive events. It can vary in type and severity. Seizure episodes can occur due to excessive electrical discharges in a group of brain cells. Various factors, including genetics, infections, brain injuries, or structural abnormalities in the brain, can cause epilepsy. In children, epilepsy can be challenging, as it can affect their cognitive development, education, and overall well-being. In pediatric epilepsy, early diagnosis and treatment are vital to providing the best possible outcome for the child. The first-line treatment for epilepsy often involves medications. However, medication will not be effective for all children, and some may experience seizures even after taking multiple medications. In such cases, pediatric epilepsy surgery becomes a viable option. ## Who Are Eligible Candidates for Pediatric Epileptic Surgery? Pediatric epileptic surgery is indicated for a limited group of children. It usually takes two or three antiepileptic medication trial failures before considering a child as a potential candidate for surgery. This decision is taken only after two or three years of continuous medication treatment. The medication failure may occur due to the following reasons. * Resistance to the available antiepileptic medication. * Side effects of the antiepileptic medication. * Or a combination of both. Since epileptic surgery might be very effective in some children, once it is clear that antiepileptic medication is not working effectively for a child, surgery should be considered.

following reasons. * Resistance to the available antiepileptic medication. * Side effects of the antiepileptic medication. * Or a combination of both. Since epileptic surgery might be very effective in some children, once it is clear that antiepileptic medication is not working effectively for a child, surgery should be considered. Epilepsy surgery is most appropriate for stubborn, frequent seizures that start in one location in the brain (focal) due to scar tissue, tumor, cyst, or another lesion that can be addressed through surgery. Surgery can be performed at a very young age, and there is no advantage in waiting for the child to be older. Also, at a young age, there is a certain degree of plasticity in the brain, which aids with the recovery of damage caused during surgery. This plasticity is higher in young kids than in older children. ## What Are the Different Types of Pediatric Epilepsy Surgery? Pediatric epilepsy surgery consists of various surgical procedures that help control or eliminate seizures in children. The choice of surgery depends on various conditions, including the type of seizures, their frequency, and the underlying cause. Some common types of pediatric epilepsy surgery include: **1) Focal Cortical Resection -** This is the most common type of pediatric epilepsy surgery. It is typically performed when seizures originate from a specific area in the brain. The surgery aims to remove the source of the seizures while preserving the nearby brain structures that are vital for specific functions. It is an open surgery,

is the most common type of pediatric epilepsy surgery. It is typically performed when seizures originate from a specific area in the brain. The surgery aims to remove the source of the seizures while preserving the nearby brain structures that are vital for specific functions. It is an open surgery, making a temporary window in the skull. Intraoperative electrode recordings and computer-assisted neuronavigation optimize the safety and efficacy. **2) Hemispherectomy -** Hemispherectomy is a surgical procedure that completely or partially removes and disconnects almost an entire half of the brain. It is also known as hemidecortication or functional hemispherectomy. It is performed in cases of more severe seizures that originate from one hemisphere of the brain. Hemispherectomy has been a very successful type of seizure surgery for very few children. The risks of hemispherectomy include hydrocephalus (abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain) and infection. **3) Corpus Callosotomy -** This surgical procedure is typically used for children with severe generalized seizures that start on either side of the brain and spread. This procedure involves severing the corpus callosum, the fibers connecting the brain's two halves. When the two hemispheres are disconnected, the spread of seizures in the brain from one side to the other can be stopped. After surgery, there may be temporary or permanent limitations in the movement of certain body parts and speech or behavior alteration. So, parents need to be informed of these complications. **4) Vagus Nerve Stimulation -**Vagus nerve stimulation is done by vagus nerve

one side to the other can be stopped. After surgery, there may be temporary or permanent limitations in the movement of certain body parts and speech or behavior alteration. So, parents need to be informed of these complications. **4) Vagus Nerve Stimulation -**Vagus nerve stimulation is done by vagus nerve stimulator (VNS). It is a device that regularly sends out electrical signals. This stimulator is mostly used when the patient has multiple or widespread sources of seizures. Intermittent electrical signals are sent to the brain by this device to interrupt the spread of a seizure. The VNS is surgically placed in the upper chest below the collarbone and connected to an electrode attached to a nerve in the neck called the vagus nerve. The number and severity of seizures can be reduced by stimulating the vagus nerve. The device is stimulated automatically throughout the day and night. Manual activation of the stimulator can be done in case of a seizure. **5) Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS) -** It is a relatively new invention in which a device is attached to the brain to continuously monitor the brain's activity and deliver targeted electrical stimulation when any abnormality is detected. **Conclusion** Pediatric epilepsy surgery can provide hope for children and their families who are fighting with the complications of epilepsy. However, surgery is not the first line of treatment for epilepsy; it is considered when two to three trials of antiepileptic medication fail, or the quality of life is significantly affected by the condition.

However, surgery is not the first line of treatment for epilepsy; it is considered when two to three trials of antiepileptic medication fail, or the quality of life is significantly affected by the condition. The decision to pursue surgery must be made in consultation with a team of experts who consider the individual child's condition and needs. </content> </article> <article> <slug>levetiracetam-for-epilepsy</slug> <content>**Overview** Levetiracetam, a new antiepileptic drug, is used to treat various seizures, including partial, myoclonic, and tonic-clonic seizures. The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved its oral use in 2000 as an additional treatment for focal seizures, myoclonic seizures, and primary generalized seizures. In 2006, the FDA also approved intravenous Levetiracetam for patients over 15 years old when the oral form was not suitable. This overview includes details about Levetiracetam's mechanism of action, how it works in the body, potential side effects, who it can benefit, and monitoring aspects. Despite being chemically different from other antiepileptic drugs, Levetiracetam stands out for its safety, unique working method, and minimal interactions with other medications, making it a promising option for managing seizures. **Drug Group** Levetiracetam is a medication used to treat epilepsy and comes in tablet form (250 mg (milligram), 500 mg, 750 mg, and 1000 mg) as well as a liquid form (100 mg/mL (milligram per milliliter)) for oral use. The tablets have different colors: blue, yellow, orange, and white. The active ingredient in

Grape-flavored liquid with a concentration of 100 mg/mL. ## For Patients ## What Is Epilepsy? Epilepsy is a brain disorder marked by recurrent seizures, which are sudden changes in behavior caused by temporary shifts in the brain's electrical activity. Normally, the brain sends out small electrical impulses in an organized way, traveling through nerve cells and the body with the help of chemical messengers. In epilepsy, these electrical rhythms can become unbalanced, leading to repeated seizures. Diagnosis typically occurs

behavior caused by temporary shifts in the brain's electrical activity. Normally, the brain sends out small electrical impulses in an organized way, traveling through nerve cells and the body with the help of chemical messengers. In epilepsy, these electrical rhythms can become unbalanced, leading to repeated seizures. Diagnosis typically occurs after experiencing at least two seizures unrelated to known medical conditions. Seizures can manifest differently based on the specific brain area affected. For instance, if a seizure originates in the part of the brain controlling thumb movement, it may start with jerking in the opposite thumb or hand, as the right brain governs the left side of the body and vice versa. ## How Does Levetiracetam Work? Levetiracetam is a medication used to treat specific types of epilepsy. Seizures are like sudden bursts of electrical activity in the brain, and Levetiracetam helps slow down these signals to prevent seizures. While the exact way it works is not fully understood, experts believe it helps calm down excessive nerve activity and lessens the spread of seizures, possibly by affecting pathways related to calcium, glycine, and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). It falls under the category of drugs called anticonvulsants. ## What Is the Dosage of Levetiracetam? Levetiracetam is a powdered medication that comes in white to an off-white color, with a subtle odor and bitter taste. It dissolves well in water, chloroform, and methanol, moderately in ethanol, less in acetonitrile, and hardly at all in n-hexane. Levetiracetam tablets contain the specified amount of the

of Levetiracetam? Levetiracetam is a powdered medication that comes in white to an off-white color, with a subtle odor and bitter taste. It dissolves well in water, chloroform, and methanol, moderately in ethanol, less in acetonitrile, and hardly at all in n-hexane. Levetiracetam tablets contain the specified amount of the medication along with other ingredients, including colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol 3350, polyethylene glycol 6000, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, titanium dioxide, and additional agents depending on the tablet strength (250 mg, 500 mg, or 750 mg). The oral solution of Levetiracetam has 100 mg of the medication in each milliliter, and its inactive components include ammonium glycyrrhizinate, citric acid monohydrate, glycerin, maltitol solution, methylparaben, potassium acesulfame, propylparaben, purified water, sodium citrate dihydrate, and natural and artificial flavoring. ## What Are the Things to Inform the Doctor Before Taking the Drug? * Inform the doctor and pharmacist about any allergies to Levetiracetam or its components. * Share details about all medications, including prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbs. * Disclose any history of kidney disease, depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts to the doctor. * Notify the doctor if the person is pregnant, planning pregnancy, or breastfeeding. * Be cautious of potential dizziness or drowsiness caused by Levetiracetam; avoid driving or operating machinery until understanding its effects. * Recognize that mental health may change unexpectedly, including experiencing suicidal thoughts. * Contact the doctor immediately if symptoms like panic attacks, restlessness, aggression, or thoughts of self-harm are noticed.

* Be cautious of potential dizziness or drowsiness caused by Levetiracetam; avoid driving or operating machinery until understanding its effects. * Recognize that mental health may change unexpectedly, including experiencing suicidal thoughts. * Contact the doctor immediately if symptoms like panic attacks, restlessness, aggression, or thoughts of self-harm are noticed. * Collaborate with the doctor to assess risks and benefits and determine the most suitable treatment plan. * Ensure the family is aware of the serious symptoms requiring prompt medical attention. ## How Is Levetiracetam Administered? 1. **Partial Onset Seizures in Adults (16 Years and Older):** Start with a daily dose of 1000 mg (milligram), given as 500 mg twice daily (BID). Adjust by adding 1000 mg/day every two weeks, reaching a maximum of 3000 mg/day. Higher doses do not consistently show increased benefits. 2. **Pediatric Patients (Four to Less Than 16 Years) For Partial Onset Seizures:** Initiate with 20 mg/kg (milligram per kilogram) in two divided doses (10 mg/kg BID). Increase every two weeks by 20 mg/kg, up to the recommended 60 mg/kg/day. Tablets or oral solutions can be used based on weight. A calibrated measuring device is essential. 3. **Myoclonic Seizures in Patients 12 Years and Older With Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy:** Start with 1000 mg/day, given as 500 mg BID. Increase by 1000 mg/day every two weeks, up to 3000 mg/day. Effectiveness below 3000 mg/day is unknown. 4. **Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures:** Adults (16 Years and Older) must be initiated with 1000 mg/day, given as 500 mg BID.

Chunk 207:
Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy:** Start with 1000 mg/day, given as 500 mg BID. Increase by 1000 mg/day every two weeks, up to 3000 mg/day. Effectiveness below 3000 mg/day is unknown. 4. **Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures:** Adults (16 Years and Older) must be initiated with 1000 mg/day, given as 500 mg BID. Increase by 1000 mg/day every two weeks, up to 3000 mg/day. Effectiveness below 3000 mg/day is unclear. Pediatric Patients (six to less than 16 Years) should follow a similar dosing pattern, starting with 20 mg/kg. 5. **Adult Patients With Impaired Renal Function:** Adjust Levetiracetam dosing according to the physicianâ€™s advice on renal function. Dosage adjustments are essential for patients with impaired renal function to ensure safety and effectiveness. ## What Are the Side Effects of Levetiracetam? * Adverse event incidence figures provided for Levetiracetam, when added to concurrent antiepileptic drug therapy, may not accurately predict occurrence in real-world medical practice. * Prescribers can use these figures as a basis to estimate the relative contribution of drug and non-drug factors to adverse event incidences in the studied population. * For partial onset seizures in adults, common adverse events with Levetiracetam combined with other drugs include somnolence (sleepiness), asthenia (weakness), infection, and dizziness. Common events in pediatric patients (four to 16 years) include somnolence, accidental injury, hostility, nervousness, and asthenia. * For myoclonic seizures, common adverse events in both adolescents and adults include somnolence, neck pain, and pharyngitis (inflammation of the pharynx). * For primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, the most frequent adverse

dizziness. Common events in pediatric patients (four to 16 years) include somnolence, accidental injury, hostility, nervousness, and asthenia. * For myoclonic seizures, common adverse events in both adolescents and adults include somnolence, neck pain, and pharyngitis (inflammation of the pharynx). * For primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, the most frequent adverse event in patients (four years and older) is nasopharyngitis (common cold). * The time course of onset for adverse events in partial-onset seizures, asthenia, somnolence, and dizziness predominantly occurs within the first four weeks of Levetiracetam treatment. * Discontinuation or dose reduction due to adverse events, in well-controlled studies for partial onset seizures, 15.0 percent of adults on Levetiracetam and 11.6 percent on placebo discontinued or reduced doses due to adverse events. In pediatric studies for partial-onset seizures, the rates were 16.8 percent for Levetiracetam and 20.6 percent for placebo. For myoclonic seizures, 8.3 percent on Levetiracetam and 1.7 percent on placebo discontinued or reduced dose. For primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, 5.1 percent on Levetiracetam and 8.3 percent on placebo discontinued or reduced dose. * Overall, the adverse experience profile was similar between females and males; there was insufficient data for age and race distributions. * Postmarketing experiences reported include abnormal liver function, hepatic failure (liver failure), hepatitis (inflammation of liver), leukopenia (decrease in number of white blood cells in blood), neutropenia (decrease in number of neutrophils in blood), pancreatitis (inflammation of pancreas), pancytopenia (low level of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count)

abnormal liver function, hepatic failure (liver failure), hepatitis (inflammation of liver), leukopenia (decrease in number of white blood cells in blood), neutropenia (decrease in number of neutrophils in blood), pancreatitis (inflammation of pancreas), pancytopenia (low level of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets), thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count) and weight loss. Alopecia (hair loss) was observed in some cases, with recovery upon Levetiracetam discontinuation. Incidence and causation are unclear. **Dietary Considerations** Keep having a regular diet unless the doctor advises differently. **Missed Dose** If a person forgets to take their medication and it has been just a few hours since the scheduled dose, they take it as soon as they remember. But if it is almost time for the next dose, just skip the missed one and stick to the usual schedule. Do not take extra to compensate for the missed dose. **Overdose** * Overdose symptoms of Levetiracetam in humans are not well-documented, but the highest known dose in clinical trials was 6000 mg/day. * Few cases of overdose in clinical trials showed only drowsiness as an adverse event. * Post-marketing cases reported symptoms like somnolence, agitation, aggression, decreased consciousness, respiratory depression (slow and shallow breathing), and coma (unconsciousness and lack of response to stimuli). * No specific antidote for Levetiracetam overdose exists. If needed, attempts to eliminate unabsorbed drugs may include inducing vomiting or gastric lavage, while maintaining airway precautions. * General supportive care, vital signs monitoring, and observation of the patient's clinical status are recommended.

(unconsciousness and lack of response to stimuli). * No specific antidote for Levetiracetam overdose exists. If needed, attempts to eliminate unabsorbed drugs may include inducing vomiting or gastric lavage, while maintaining airway precautions. * General supportive care, vital signs monitoring, and observation of the patient's clinical status are recommended. Consult a Poison control center for updated guidance on managing Levetiracetam overdose. * Hemodialysis (a machine that filters wastes, salts, and fluid from the blood when kidneys no longer work), though not performed in known cases, may be considered for significant clearance of the drug in cases of overdose, especially in patients with renal impairment. **Storage:** Keep Levetiracetam at room temperature, around 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius), with short excursions allowed between 59 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 30 degrees Celsius). ## For Doctors **Indications:** * Levetiracetam is prescribed as an adjunctive therapy for partial-onset seizures in adults and children (four years and older) with epilepsy. * It is indicated as an adjunctive therapy for myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents (12 years and older) diagnosed with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. * Levetiracetam is recommended as adjunctive therapy for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults and children (six years and older) with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. * Off-label uses include treatment for status epilepticus and seizure prophylaxis in subarachnoid hemorrhage. * It is also utilized off-label for the prophylaxis of traumatic brain injury and supratentorial neurosurgery. * Levetiracetam is employed off-label for managing seizures in palliative care. **Dose:** Levetiracetam is a

It has high solubility in water (104.0 g (gram)/100 mL), chloroform, and methanol, moderate solubility in ethanol, low solubility in acetonitrile, and is nearly insoluble in n-hexane. The Levetiracetam tablets contain the specified amount of Levetiracetam along with inactive components, including colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol 3350, polyethylene glycol 6000, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, titanium dioxide, and additional agents that vary based on the tablet strength (250 mg, 500 mg, or 750 mg). The Levetiracetam oral solution has 100 mg of Levetiracetam per mL (milliliter) and includes inactive ingredients such as ammonium glycyrrhizinate, citric acid monohydrate, glycerin, maltitol solution, methylparaben, potassium acesulfame, propylparaben, purified water, sodium citrate dihydrate, and natural and artificial flavoring. **Dosing Considerations:** * Levetiracetam is recommended as an adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures in adults and children aged four years and older with epilepsy. * It is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for managing myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older diagnosed with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. * Levetiracetam is indicated as adjunctive therapy for treating primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults and children aged six

years and older with epilepsy. * It is also indicated as adjunctive therapy for managing myoclonic seizures in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older diagnosed with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. * Levetiracetam is indicated as adjunctive therapy for treating primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults and children aged six years and older with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. **Pharmacological Aspects of Levetiracetam** * **Pharmacodynamics:** The impact of Levetiracetam on the prolongation of QTc interval was assessed in a controlled crossover study involving 52 healthy subjects. The study included both positive control (Moxifloxacin 400 mg) and placebo groups, with Levetiracetam administered at doses of 1000 mg or 5000 mg. The results indicated that the upper limit of the 90 percent confidence interval for the largest placebo-adjusted, baseline-corrected QTc did not exceed 10 milliseconds. Therefore, there was no significant evidence of QTc prolongation associated with Levetiracetam in this investigation. * **Mechanism of Action:** The exact mechanism of Levetiracetam's antiepileptic effects is unclear. The drug showed limited impact on single seizures induced by various stimuli but demonstrated protective effects against secondarily generalized activity from focal seizures and inhibitory properties in the kindling model. In both in vitro and in vivo studies, Levetiracetam inhibited hippocampal burst firing without affecting normal neuronal excitability, suggesting it may selectively prevent hypersynchronization of epileptiform burst firing and seizure spread. Levetiracetam, up to 10 Î¼M (micromoles) concentrations, lacked binding affinity for known epilepsy-associated receptors and did not directly affect neuronal sodium or calcium currents. However, it opposed negative modulators of

burst firing without affecting normal neuronal excitability, suggesting it may selectively prevent hypersynchronization of epileptiform burst firing and seizure spread. Levetiracetam, up to 10 Î¼M (micromoles) concentrations, lacked binding affinity for known epilepsy-associated receptors and did not directly affect neuronal sodium or calcium currents. However, it opposed negative modulators of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)- and glycine-gated currents and partially inhibited N-type calcium currents. Experimental data identified a saturable binding site for Levetiracetam in rat brain tissue as the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A (synaptic vesicle glycoprotein), involved in vesicle exocytosis regulation. While the molecular significance remains unclear, Levetiracetam's affinity for SV2A and related analogs correlated with their antiseizure potency in mice, suggesting a potential contribution to its antiepileptic mechanism. * **Pharmacokinetics:** Levetiracetam's pharmacokinetics were studied in various populations, including healthy adults, epilepsy patients (adults and children), the elderly, and those with renal or hepatic impairment. The drug is rapidly absorbed orally, with linear and time-invariant pharmacokinetics and low variability. Bioequivalence exists between tablets and oral solution, and bioavailability is unaffected by food, with minimal protein binding (less than 10 percent). About 66 percent of the dose is renally excreted unchanged. Levetiracetam's major metabolic pathway (24 percent of dose) involves enzymatic hydrolysis, independent of liver cytochrome P450. Metabolites lack pharmacological activity and are renally excreted. Plasma half-life is six to eight hours, increased in the elderly and those with renal impairment due to reduced clearance. Absorption is rapid, with peak concentrations reached in about an hour. Oral bioavailability is 100 percent, and pharmacokinetics

of liver cytochrome P450. Metabolites lack pharmacological activity and are renally excreted. Plasma half-life is six to eight hours, increased in the elderly and those with renal impairment due to reduced clearance. Absorption is rapid, with peak concentrations reached in about an hour. Oral bioavailability is 100 percent, and pharmacokinetics remain linear across a dose range of 500-5000 mg (milligram), achieving steady state after two days of twice-daily dosing. Food decreases peak concentration by 20 percent and delays time to peak concentration by 1.5 hours. Minimal metabolism occurs in humans, primarily through enzymatic hydrolysis. The major metabolite, ucb L057, is inactive in seizure models. Elimination is mainly through renal excretion, with 66 percent unchanged drug. Clearance correlates with creatinine clearance, and renal clearance of ucb L057 involves glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion. In adults, plasma half-life is seven Â± one hour, unaffected by dose or repeated administration. Total body clearance is 0.96 mL/min/kg (milliliter per minute per kilogram), with renal clearance at 0.6 mL/min/kg. Excretion involves glomerular filtration and partial tubular reabsorption, and the metabolite ucb L057 is excreted via glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, with a renal clearance of four mL/min/kg. Clearance is reduced in renal impairment. **Clinical Studies:** Levetiracetam's efficacy as adjunctive therapy for refractory partial onset seizures in adults was assessed in three placebo-controlled studies. These studies involved 904 patients randomized to receive placebo or different doses of Levetiracetam (1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg/day).

**Clinical Studies:** Levetiracetam's efficacy as adjunctive therapy for refractory partial onset seizures in adults was assessed in three placebo-controlled studies. These studies involved 904 patients randomized to receive placebo or different doses of Levetiracetam (1000 mg, 2000 mg, or 3000 mg/day). The trials demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in weekly partial seizure frequency compared to placebo, with a primary focus on achieving a â‰¥ 50 percent reduction. Study one, conducted in the U.S. (United States), showed that both 1000 mg/day and 3000 mg/day of Levetiracetam led to a significant reduction in seizure frequency compared to placebo. Study two, carried out in Europe, revealed a statistically significant difference in responder rates between the 2000 mg/day and 1000 mg/day doses. Study three, also in Europe, demonstrated a significant reduction in seizure frequency with 3000 mg/day compared to placebo. The results, presented graphically, highlight the percentage of patients achieving a â‰¥ 50 percent reduction in weekly seizure rates for each treatment group. These findings underscore Levetiracetam's effectiveness in reducing seizure frequency in adults with refractory partial-onset seizures. ## What Are the Contraindications of Levetiracetam? * Hypersensitivity reaction to Levetiracetam or its excipients is a contraindication. * Levetiracetam use can lead to anaphylaxis or angioedema. * If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs and an alternative cause cannot be determined, discontinuation of Levetiracetam should be permanent. **Warnings and Precautions:** * Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Levetiracetam, elevate the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients across all indications. * Patients using any AED should be closely

Due to its potential to induce sedation and central nervous system (CNS) depression, Levetiracetam may amplify the CNS-depressant effects of substances like alcohol, cannabis, and certain drugs, including Azelastine, Carbamazepine, and Opioids. Concurrent use with enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs, such as Phenytoin

Due to its potential to induce sedation and central nervous system (CNS) depression, Levetiracetam may amplify the CNS-depressant effects of substances like alcohol, cannabis, and certain drugs, including Azelastine, Carbamazepine, and Opioids. Concurrent use with enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs, such as Phenytoin and Carbamazepine, led to a nine to 22 percent increase in Levetiracetam clearance. Conversely, co-administration with enzyme-inhibitor drugs like Valproate resulted in an 18.8 percent reduction in Levetiracetam clearance. **Specific Considerations:** 1. **Pregnancy:** Levetiracetam levels may decrease during pregnancy. There might be potential risks to the fetus. Animal studies showed developmental issues at doses similar to or greater than human therapeutic doses. Use during pregnancy only if potential benefits outweigh potential risks. 2. **Labor and Delivery:** Unknown effects of Levetiracetam on labor and delivery in humans. 3. **Nursing Mothers:** Levetiracetam is present in human milk. Considering the potential risks to nursing infants, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or the drug. 4. **Pediatric Use** : Levetiracetamâ€™s safety and effectiveness are established in various pediatric age groups for specific seizure types. Neurocognitive and behavioral effects were studied in pediatric patients; no formal statistical non-inferiority was assessed. Studies in juvenile animals did not indicate age-specific toxicity. 5. **Geriatric Use:** No overall safety differences were observed between elderly and younger subjects. Elderly patients may have decreased renal function, so dose selection should be careful. 6. **Renal Impairment:** Levetiracetam clearance is reduced in patients with renal impairment.

Epilepsy is a disorder of the nervous system in which a person suffers from one or more seizures that occur in the absence of any triggers (unprovoked seizures). These seizures usually occur at a time difference of more than 24 hours. Epilepsy could be a common cause of seizures. Approximately 11 percent of people experience seizures once in their lifetime. ## What Are Seizures? The human brain is a very complex electrical unit that uses electric power to send neural signals through the entire body. When these electric signals are interrupted, brain activity is hampered, giving rise to seizures. Seizures are usually described as irregular, abnormal activity of the nerves in the brain. These irregularities can sometimes become recurrent or persistent (chronic). They cause a surge in the brain, affecting several brain functions. Seizures can lead to abnormal movements, perceptiveness, or unusual life experiences. When seizures become chronic in nature, the

usually described as irregular, abnormal activity of the nerves in the brain. These irregularities can sometimes become recurrent or persistent (chronic). They cause a surge in the brain, affecting several brain functions. Seizures can lead to abnormal movements, perceptiveness, or unusual life experiences. When seizures become chronic in nature, the condition is referred to as epilepsy. It is possible to have seizures without an epileptic attack, but epilepsy without seizures is not possible. **Causes of Nonepileptic Seizures** * Persistent fever. * Head injury. * Meningitis (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain). * Difficulty breathing due to windpipe obstruction. * Withdrawal symptoms due to alcohol. * Drug withdrawal symptoms. * Hypertension (high blood pressure). * metabolic disorders such as renal or liver failure. * Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels). * Brain stroke. * Brain tumors. * Autoimmune disorders like lupus. ## What Are the Types of Seizures? Seizures can be classified into two categories. 1. Generalized Seizures. 2. Focal Seizures. **Generalized Seizures:** * **Absence Seizures-** These types of seizures make a person lose attention, wink rapidly and repetitively, or gaze out into empty spaces for a few seconds. They affect both sides of the brain. * **Tonic-clonic Seizures-** These seizures may cause a person to cry out loud, stumble upon the ground, or experience strong muscular jerks. **Focal Seizures** * **Simple Focal Seizures-** These seizures affect only a small portion of the brain. Therefore, minimal symptoms like a peculiar taste in the mouth or a minor spasm (twitch). * **Complex

may cause a person to cry out loud, stumble upon the ground, or experience strong muscular jerks. **Focal Seizures** * **Simple Focal Seizures-** These seizures affect only a small portion of the brain. Therefore, minimal symptoms like a peculiar taste in the mouth or a minor spasm (twitch). * **Complex Focal Seizures-** Multiple areas of the brain are involved and may cause mental confusion. Patients may become disoriented and not able to respond for a few minutes. * **Secondary Generalized Seizures-** These types of seizures begin as focal seizures in one part of the brain, gradually progressing to a generalized seizure. Most seizures last for not more than five to six minutes. Some may last for a few seconds only.` ## What Is Epilepsy? If the seizures become chronic and recurrent, they may lead to epilepsy. Epilepsy may, therefore, be defined as a chronic seizure disease. It is diagnosed by the healthcare professionals under the following circumstances. * Where there is an absence of triggers like the absence of a head injury or a brain or meningeal infection. * When the patient suffers a minimum of two epileptic seizures at a gap of more than 24 hours, multiple seizures that occur within a 24-hour period do not suggest epilepsy. * When the electrical tests run in the brain, the symptoms are nothing but seizures. However, it is very important for the healthcare professional to make a correct diagnosis. After experiencing the first seizure symptoms, it is important for a person

occur within a 24-hour period do not suggest epilepsy. * When the electrical tests run in the brain, the symptoms are nothing but seizures. However, it is very important for the healthcare professional to make a correct diagnosis. After experiencing the first seizure symptoms, it is important for a person to consult a doctor immediately. The doctor will ask for a complete medical history of the patient, including an exclusive detailed history of every seizure, any drug history, any medical conditions, or any recent head injuries. Usually, a neurological examination is performed to examine the cranial nerves and reflexes. Often, an electroencephalogram (EEG) test is carried out to diagnose epilepsy by demonstrating the specific patterns of electrical stimuli inside the brain. ## What Are the Differences Between Seizures and Epilepsy? There are some important differences between seizures and epilepsy that include: * Seizures are a result of an independent electrical brain activity that behaves abnormally in an individual. Epilepsy, on the other hand, is a result of chronic and repetitive seizure activity. It is, therefore, crucial to treat the underlying pathology of individual seizures. * Nonepileptic seizures that may occur in a few medical conditions may be life-threatening and fatal. A person can also die due to severe dehydration, uncontrolled diabetes, or a traumatic brain injury. * Seizures occur as a result of an underlying medical condition that has triggered abnormal brain activity. Therefore, a person may exhibit symptoms like high blood pressure or malnutrition. Epilepsy occurs in the absence

Chunk 222:
A person can also die due to severe dehydration, uncontrolled diabetes, or a traumatic brain injury. * Seizures occur as a result of an underlying medical condition that has triggered abnormal brain activity. Therefore, a person may exhibit symptoms like high blood pressure or malnutrition. Epilepsy occurs in the absence of any trigger. It is usually an unprovoked seizure activity. * It is important to exclude other syndromes and neurological disorders in order to diagnose epilepsy. Whereas in the case of seizures, a single test may sometimes give clarity. For instance, if a person is experiencing seizures and has high blood sugar levels, it can be easily concluded by the healthcare professional that uncontrolled diabetes is the main cause of it. ## What Are the Similarities Between Seizures and Epilepsy? Epilepsy and seizures related to other diseases have several factors in common. These include: * The symptoms of both seizures and epilepsy are the same. They will not be helpful in distinguishing epilepsy from seizures. * Both epilepsy and seizures have similar complications. They increase the patientâ€™s risk of injury from stumbling upon, car accidents, and unconsciousness. * In both epilepsy and seizure diseases, the convulsions themselves are not dangerous. A fit or seizure is considered a medical emergency if it lasts for more than five to six minutes and causes severe trauma or injury. * It is crucial for the healthcare professional to consider both possibilities, as the patient may suffer from epilepsy and have another disease that causes

for epilepsy, a neurological condition marked by recurring seizures, fail, surgery is frequently required. Preoperative mapping is a fundamental aspect of these surgical treatments that helps neurosurgeons pinpoint the epileptogenic center precisely while maintaining important brain functions. The precision and safety of epilepsy surgery have greatly increased because to functional imaging techniques such as Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), magnetoencephalography (MEG), positron emission tomography (PET), and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). These technologies offer dynamic insights into brain activity, enabling customized treatment regimens based on the particular brain anatomy of each patient as well as the precise location of their epileptogenic zone. With the use of artificial intelligence, 3D visualization, and sophisticated imaging modalities, surgical success rates have increased, and postoperative problems have decreased, providing hope to those with drug-resistant epilepsy. ## What Is the Significance of Preoperative Mapping in Epilepsy Surgery? A critical first step in the surgical management of epilepsy is preoperative mapping, which identifies and localizes the precise brain areas causing seizure activity. There are various reasons why this method is very important. * **Quality Treatment:** Because epilepsy is such a diverse disorder, each patient's experience with it will be unique in terms of both its onset and course. A customized treatment plan based on the epileptogenic focus's location and the patient's particular brain anatomy is made possible by preoperative mapping.

and course. A customized treatment plan based on the epileptogenic focus's location and the patient's particular brain anatomy is made possible by preoperative mapping. Complete excision of the epileptogenic focus is critical for a satisfactory outcome of epilepsy surgery. By ensuring that the entire afflicted area is removed during surgery, preoperative mapping increases the chance of long-term seizure independence by preventing the needless removal of healthy tissue. Preoperative mapping assists neurosurgeons in planning surgery to save the delicate brain regions that control vital processes such as speech, motor control, and sensory perception. This preserves the patient's quality of life by reducing the possibility of postoperative impairments. * **Better Surgical Planning:** Preoperative mapping aids in identifying the precise region of the brain that gives rise to seizures. Because it allows neurosurgeons to design their approach with a high degree of accuracy, decreasing the danger of damaging healthy brain tissue and boosting the possibility of controlling seizures, this precision is essential. Accurate mapping aids in avoiding postoperative problems that may arise when extensive brain resection is required as a result of insufficient epileptogenic zone localization, such as infection or excessive bleeding. For those with drug-resistant epilepsy, efficient preoperative mapping can greatly enhance prognosis and potentially lead to a life free of seizures and enhanced general quality of life. Preoperative mapping is crucial to epilepsy surgery because it increases surgical accuracy, customizes care to the patient's unique needs, lowers the risk of complications, and ultimately raises the prospect of seizure control and improved

diagnosis and staging of a wide range of illnesses, such as cancer and neurological conditions. PET scans help research brain and systemic illnesses and provide information on tissue function by revealing areas of aberrant activity. 3. **Diffuse Tensor Imaging:** DTI is essential for mapping white matter tracts because it detects the diffusion of water molecules in brain tissue. This is especially crucial for maintaining connectivity after surgery because it helps prevent critical brain circuits from being damaged. 4. **Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT):** Radiotracers are used in Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), a medical imaging technique that produces three-dimensional images of interior structures. It is useful for evaluating blood flow and locating regions of impaired perfusion in several organs, especially the brain. By measuring the gamma radiation released from the tracers, SPECT aids in the diagnosis of diseases such as stroke, heart disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. It also provides information on tissue function and informs therapy choices. 5. **Intracranial Electroencephalography (iEEG):** Electrodes are positioned directly on the surface or inside the brain during an invasive neuroimaging procedure called intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) to monitor electrical activity. In particular, it offers high-resolution data on the mapping of important brain areas and the location of epileptogenic zones. When planning epilepsy surgery, iEEG is essential because it provides accurate information about abnormal brain activity and helps protect critical brain functions. **Conclusion:** The field of preoperative mapping in epilepsy surgery has changed dramatically due to the quick development of functional imaging tools.

epilepsy, it is also employed for various other seizure disorders. Phenytoin is also regarded as an antiepileptic medicine. In 1939, the drug regulatory authority of the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), endorsed the usage of Phenytoin sodium for tackling epilepsy. Earlier, it was also advised to counteract certain drug toxicities like tricyclic antidepressant toxicity (overdose intake of antidepressant medicines) and Digoxin toxicity. **Drug Group:** Phenytoin sodium is categorized under the class of anticonvulsant medicines, typically belonging to the first generation. It is a derivative of hydantoin, which checks the aberrant electrical processes in the brain. The chemical structure of Phenytoin sodium is similar to that of barbiturates, and 5,5-diphenyl-2,4-imidazolidinedione is the chemical name that denotes Phenytoin sodium. **Available Doses and Dosage Forms:** Phenytoin sodium is marketed in chewable tablet form, capsule form, particularly in extended-release formulations, and liquid form as oral suspension and injection material. 30 milligrams (mg) and 100 mg Phenytoin sodium capsules are the available and circulated dosages of extended-release Phenytoin capsules. ## For Patients: **What Is Epilepsy?** Epilepsy is a specific neurological condition that is precipitated by aberrant signal generation in the brain cells. It is often manifested in the form of obvious seizures (turbulent and jerky movements of legs and arms). Nerve cells in the brain initiate certain electrical signals. It is through these signals the nerve cells communicate with each other and with muscle fibers and organs. Once the signals interact with the muscle fibers, they bring about movements. In epilepsy, there

(turbulent and jerky movements of legs and arms). Nerve cells in the brain initiate certain electrical signals. It is through these signals the nerve cells communicate with each other and with muscle fibers and organs. Once the signals interact with the muscle fibers, they bring about movements. In epilepsy, there will be exaggerated and aberrant signal initiation in the nerves. Simultaneously, many nerves liberate signals to various target sites, eventually giving rise to abnormal and uncontrolled sensations, including body movement. The patient will lose their awareness and orientation during an epilepsy attack. Epilepsy is considered to be a multifactorial condition, where numerous factors contribute to the development of this brain disorder. Aberrant brain functioning, developmental errors, alteration in the genes, abnormal growth within the brain, severe brain infections, and injury are identified to be the causative factors that can pave the way for epilepsy. In epileptic patients, the seizure activity is elicited even without any kind of provocation, unlike the seizures accompanying a high fever. Epilepsy is frequently reported in younger as well as older population groups. Epilepsy is categorized into distinct groups considering the intensity and pattern of the seizure. Anti-epileptic medications are the mainstay medicines for tackling the manifestations of epilepsy. Various parameters like the patient's medical condition, health status, age, and seizure pattern aid in determining the most appropriate anti-epileptic medicine for that particular patient. ## How Does Phenytoin Sodium Work?

manifestations of epilepsy. Various parameters like the patient's medical condition, health status, age, and seizure pattern aid in determining the most appropriate anti-epileptic medicine for that particular patient. ## How Does Phenytoin Sodium Work? Phenytoin sodium checks the aberrant brain function by hindering exaggerated impulse generation. It gears down the pace of signal production by acting on specific points in the brain cells. Once the impulse production is decelerated, repeated seizure activity will be suspended as it requires repetitious impulses to sustain the seizure. In this way, Phenytoin sodium works to check the manifestation of epilepsy. ## What Is the Dosage of Phenytoin Sodium? * **Adult Dose:** 300 milligrams (mg) of extended-release formulation of Phenytoin sodium is the widely preferred daily inceptive dose for the adult population, provided the patient has no prior encounter with Phenytoin sodium. During the treatment inception, 300 mg of Phenytoin sodium should be given in divided doses with a daily frequency of three. However, necessary adjustments in the dose will be advised by the concerned doctor if required. The maximum advisable daily dose for Phenytoin sodium is two 100 mg capsules at a frequency of three times. The extended-release formulation of Phenytoin sodium offers a once-a-day dosage regimen, where the patient can take 300 mg of Phenytoin sodium as a single dose. The once-a-day dosage regimen is often employed for non-compliant patients who are reluctant to stick to multiple dosage regimens. The Single dose regimen is initiated only in patients who elicited fruitful results with

once-a-day dosage regimen, where the patient can take 300 mg of Phenytoin sodium as a single dose. The once-a-day dosage regimen is often employed for non-compliant patients who are reluctant to stick to multiple dosage regimens. The Single dose regimen is initiated only in patients who elicited fruitful results with divided doses. * **Pediatric Dose:** The dosage of Phenytoin sodium for the pediatric population is determined by taking into account the childâ€™s body weight. Five milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day) is the recommended dosage, which should be administered as divided doses rather than a single dose. ## How Effective Is Phenytoin Sodium? Phenytoin sodium is a widely prescribed antiepileptic medicine with proven efficacy in tackling epileptic manifestations. Phenytoin sodium is reported to be highly potent in mitigating the manifestations of focal onset seizures (aberrant signal generation confined to a specific point in the brain), reported in most epileptic patients. However, it is not recommended as a single therapy for petit mal epilepsy (patients experience momentarily awareness loss). In such cases, Phenytoin sodium, in combination with other potent antiepileptic medication, is advised. ## What Are the Things to Inform the Doctor Before Taking the Drug? Before commencing the therapy using Phenytoin sodium, the concerned doctors should be informed of certain information concerning the patient. * Any previous allergic or hypersensitivity encounter with Phenytoin sodium or other medicines that fall under the same class of anticonvulsant medications should be discussed with the doctor beforehand. Subsequent exposure to an allergic component can

Phenytoin sodium, the concerned doctors should be informed of certain information concerning the patient. * Any previous allergic or hypersensitivity encounter with Phenytoin sodium or other medicines that fall under the same class of anticonvulsant medications should be discussed with the doctor beforehand. Subsequent exposure to an allergic component can trigger alarming reactions in the body, which demand immediate medical attention. In addition, an allergic response to any of the components indicated in the drug label needs to be informed as it can also act as a potential trigger for severe allergic responses. * It is imperative to keep the doctor aware of the patientâ€™s medical history. A comprehensive medical history of the patient encompassing the underlying medical conditions and details of the patientâ€™s past medical conditions helps the doctor evaluate the patientâ€™s health status and assess the possibility of Phenytoin-induced worsening of any underlying ailments. * Detailed drug history is another crucial piece of information that is essential to ensure the effectiveness of the medicine and its safety. The doctor should be informed about the patientâ€™s drug history, encompassing dietary supplements, herbal medicines, and other over-the-counter medicines. Medicines belonging to the class of antacids, antifungals, anticoagulants, antivirals, immunosuppressants, and antimalarials can interfere with Phenytoinâ€™s processing and actions. A patient's drug history aids in checking unwanted drug-to-drug associations and their potential impact on the patientâ€™s body. * The doctor should be made aware of the patientâ€™s pregnancy and breastfeeding status.

antimalarials can interfere with Phenytoinâ€™s processing and actions. A patient's drug history aids in checking unwanted drug-to-drug associations and their potential impact on the patientâ€™s body. * The doctor should be made aware of the patientâ€™s pregnancy and breastfeeding status. Phenytoin sodium can precipitate potential toxicities in the baby developing in the womb when consumed by the expectant mother. Effective birth control measures should be undertaken to check accidental conception during Phenytoin therapy. In addition, if the patient is planning for conception in the near future, the doctor should be informed about this so that appropriate changes in the medicine choice can be made beforehand. **How Is Phenytoin Sodium Administered?** The extended-release formulation of Phenytoin sodium capsules is made available in the market as capsules, and hence, the oral route is the indicated administration route. Chewable tablet forms and oral suspension forms are also available for oral intake, but the dose and drug concentration vary. Phenytoin capsule should be swallowed with a glass of water without fracturing or breaking it. ## What Are the Side Effects of Phenytoin Sodium? There is a wide range of side effects that are precipitated during Phenytoin therapy. Some of the frequently reported adverse effects concerning Phenytoin include the following: * Sleeping disturbances, mental confusion, and dizziness are often found to be associated with Phenytoin therapy. * Phenytoin intake can precipitate gastrointestinal issues in the form of vomiting, stomach pain, liver disorders, appetite loss, constipation, and nausea.

concerning Phenytoin include the following: * Sleeping disturbances, mental confusion, and dizziness are often found to be associated with Phenytoin therapy. * Phenytoin intake can precipitate gastrointestinal issues in the form of vomiting, stomach pain, liver disorders, appetite loss, constipation, and nausea. Altered taste sensations and persisting headaches are other potential adverse effects of Phenytoin. * Long-term therapy using Phenytoin often impacts speech. Speech becomes unclear and slurred. Exaggerated growth of the lips, gums, and hair is often elicited during Phenytoin therapy. * Eyeball elicits fluttering movements, giving rise to nystagmus (aberrant eye movements). In addition, abnormal muscle twitching and body movements are also reported during the therapy. * More severe forms of adverse reactions are presented in the form of skin reactions, widespread skin rashes, skin hives or bumps, blisters, abnormal skin pigmentation, and pinpoint blood-colored dots over the skin. * Mouth ulcers, facial puffiness, exhaustion, short breaths, troubled breathing, chest discomfort, and heart racing are some of the alarming side effects that entail immediate medical care for the patient. **Dietary Considerations:** There are no specific dietary instructions that need to be followed while on Phenytoin therapy. At times, the concerned healthcare specialist may advise certain dietary considerations, taking into account the patientâ€™s health status and concurrent medical conditions that the patient suffers from. In such cases, the patients should adhere to those instructions promptly. **Missed Dose:** The patients are instructed to strictly adhere to the dosage frequency and regimen advised by the doctors. It is better to follow

into account the patientâ€™s health status and concurrent medical conditions that the patient suffers from. In such cases, the patients should adhere to those instructions promptly. **Missed Dose:** The patients are instructed to strictly adhere to the dosage frequency and regimen advised by the doctors. It is better to follow a specific time for the intake of the medicines, which ensures a consistent concentration of medicine in the blood throughout the treatment course. However, at times, patients may fail to take the medicine in the stipulated time. In such cases, the patient can take the medicine once they become aware of the overlooked dose, provided there is enough time gap for the subsequent dose. If the patient recalls the overlooked dose at the time of the subsequent dose, it is advised to skip or disregard the missed one, and the patient can go ahead with the subsequent dose. It is strictly warned not to take double the prescribed dose to make up for the overlooked one, as it can bring in complex adverse reactions. **Overdose:** Consuming more than the estimated safe dose can bring about serious overdose issues. Neurological manifestations are mostly encountered upon oral overdose. In addition, it can severely impact the way in which the heart and its associated blood vessels function. However, cardiovascular effects are more pronounced with overdose induced by parenteral (through veins) introduction of Phenytoin. The Phenytoin dose exceeding two grams is estimated to be lethal and grave for the patient. The severity and intensity

severely impact the way in which the heart and its associated blood vessels function. However, cardiovascular effects are more pronounced with overdose induced by parenteral (through veins) introduction of Phenytoin. The Phenytoin dose exceeding two grams is estimated to be lethal and grave for the patient. The severity and intensity of neurological manifestations of Phenytoin are directly proportional to the drugâ€™s concentration in the blood. It ranges from nystagmus (aberrant eye movement) to coma (unresponsive and unconscious state). Other manifestations like sleepiness, diminishing muscle control, fine tremors, unclear speech, and mental confusion are also identified during Phenytoin overdose. It entails immediate medical care; otherwise, it has the potential to precipitate death by multiorgan failures. **Storage:** Extended-release Phenytoin pills either come on blister packaging or in medicine bottles. It is advised to keep the pills in the packaging until the time of consumption. 20 to 25 degrees Celsius (68 to 77 degrees Fahrenheit) is the estimated safe temperature range for Phenytoin extended-release pill storage. Moisture, excessive heat, and sunlight can impact the pill constituents, hence mandating proper storage. ## For Doctors: **Indication:** * Grand mal epilepsy. * Psychomotor seizures. * Seizures encountered during or after neurological surgery (prevention and management). **Dose:** **1\. Dosage for Adult Patients:** An inceptive dose of 100 mg at a daily frequency of three times is recommended to be the standard dose of extended- release Phenytoin for patients with no prior exposure to Phenytoin sodium.

**1\. Dosage for Adult Patients:** An inceptive dose of 100 mg at a daily frequency of three times is recommended to be the standard dose of extended- release Phenytoin for patients with no prior exposure to Phenytoin sodium. After analyzing the patient's response to the inceptive dose, the doctor will modify the dosage accordingly and determine the accurate maintenance dose. The maintenance dose can be administered either as a single or divided dose: * **Single-Dose Regimen:** Once the inceptive doses are well tolerated, a single-dose regimen can be initiated, where a single dose of 300 mg of extended-release Phenytoin pill formulation is administered on a daily basis. This regimen is mostly advised for non-compliant patients. * **Divided-Dose Regimen:** 300 mg of daily dose is administered in the form of three divided doses of 100mg. * **Loading Dose:** Oral loading dose is restricted to patients in the hospital with obvious access for constant monitoring of the drugâ€™s concentration, who cannot tolerate parenteral administration. **2\. Dosage for Pediatric Patients:** For pediatric patients under six years of age, five milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day is the recommended daily dosage. No single-dose regimen is preferred for pediatric patients; the daily dose needs to be split into smaller doses and given at a daily frequency of two or three times. **Dosing Considerations:** Though there is a standard dosage regimen, the dosage requirement of Phenytoin sodium extended-release pills may vary on an individual basis.

needs to be split into smaller doses and given at a daily frequency of two or three times. **Dosing Considerations:** Though there is a standard dosage regimen, the dosage requirement of Phenytoin sodium extended-release pills may vary on an individual basis. Post-dosage monitoring of the drugâ€™s concentration in the blood aids the doctor in determining the most accurate dose for that particular patient so that necessary alterations in the dosage can be initiated. However, a minimum of seven days interval should be given between each dose change. While shifting from one Phenytoin formulation to another, appropriate dose correction needs to be made. Otherwise, it can end up in either enhanced or collapsed drug concentration in the blood. ## What Are the Pharmacological Aspects of Phenytoin Sodium? * **Mechanism:** Phenytoin sodium checks the exponential rise in membrane action potential by hindering the voltage-gated membrane sodium channels in the brain nerves. It hampers and restricts the continual release of neuronal signals. By restricting the action potential, the positive feedback mechanism will be interrupted, which eventually breaks the continuous firing of the action potential. In the absence of continuous, uninterrupted firing, sustained seizure activity cannot be precipitated, and in this way, Phenytoin sodium collapses the epileptic manifestations. * **Pharmacodynamics:** Voltage-gated sodium channels are hindered by Phenytoin in such a way that it only curbs the firing at high frequency. This ensures that normal brain functioning and activities go unhindered and trouble-free, even in the presence of active Phenytoin in the blood. * **Pharmacokinetics:**

collapses the epileptic manifestations. * **Pharmacodynamics:** Voltage-gated sodium channels are hindered by Phenytoin in such a way that it only curbs the firing at high frequency. This ensures that normal brain functioning and activities go unhindered and trouble-free, even in the presence of active Phenytoin in the blood. * **Pharmacokinetics:** Being an extended-release formulation, the utmost blood concentration is attained in four to 12 hours post-oral intake. In a span of seven to 10 days, consistency in the blood concentration of Phenytoin sodium will be established. Plasma proteins are concerned with the distribution of the Phenytoin sodium drug molecules. However, once the drug molecules attach to these plasma proteins, they lose their pharmacological effectiveness. An appreciable concentration of free Phenytoin drug molecules is recorded in the central nervous system (CNS), which enhances the effectiveness of Phenytoin in tackling CNS issues. The liver enzymes, particularly the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, are concerned with the metabolism and breaking down of Phenytoin. Among the cytochrome P450 enzyme series, cytochrome P2C9 and P2C19 are responsible for the metabolism. Elimination and removal of Phenytoin from the body is primarily through the urinary route. **Toxicity:** Non-clinical toxicological studies have been conducted to demonstrate the carcinogenicity and mutagenicity associated with Phenytoin therapy. Long-term studies on mice with an appreciably higher dose of Phenytoin precipitated incidences of carcinogenesis in the form of hepatocellular tumors. However, studies on rats could not expose any carcinogenic association. Incidences of fertility impairment and clastogenic changes were neither reported in mice nor in

mutagenicity associated with Phenytoin therapy. Long-term studies on mice with an appreciably higher dose of Phenytoin precipitated incidences of carcinogenesis in the form of hepatocellular tumors. However, studies on rats could not expose any carcinogenic association. Incidences of fertility impairment and clastogenic changes were neither reported in mice nor in rats. **Clinical Studies:** Comparative clinical studies have been conducted to elucidate the potency of Phenytoin sodium extended-release formulations in tackling epileptic manifestations. These randomized studies concluded that the efficacy of Phenytoin sodium is on par with other anticonvulsants like Sodium valproate. ## What Are the Contraindications of Phenytoin Sodium? Phenytoin is not advisable to all patients; there are certain conditions in which Phenytoin administration can pose health risks to the patients. * Patients with known allergic encounters with Phenytoin are not advised to take oral extended-release formulations. Allergy or exaggerated reactivity to any of the medicines that belong to the group of hydantoins also carries the risk of eliciting an allergic response towards Phenytoin. * Patients with a past incidence of functional impairment of the liver triggered by Phenytoin are also contraindicated to Phenytoin therapy. * Pregnant women are not supposed to undergo therapy using Phenytoin, as it can bring about fetal harm and birth defects. * Phenytoin therapy is contraindicated for patients who are simultaneously undergoing therapy using non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors like Delavirdine. **Warnings and Precautions:** * **Status Epilepticus:** Phenytoin therapy should not be terminated all of a sudden; instead, gradual depreciation in the dose is advised to

about fetal harm and birth defects. * Phenytoin therapy is contraindicated for patients who are simultaneously undergoing therapy using non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors like Delavirdine. **Warnings and Precautions:** * **Status Epilepticus:** Phenytoin therapy should not be terminated all of a sudden; instead, gradual depreciation in the dose is advised to guide the withdrawal smoothly and safely. Sudden withdrawal from Phenytoin therapy precipitates status epilepticus. * **Grave Skin Reactions:** Phenytoin therapy is capable of triggering grave skin reactions in the form of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic syndrome (DRESS), toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). These grave skin reactions are encountered within the first month after the commencement of Phenytoin therapy, and hence, patients should be cautioned about the appearance of skin rash. * **Suicidal Tendency:** Being an antiepileptic drug, Phenytoin is capable of modifying oneâ€™s thought process. An enhanced suicidal tendency is elicited with all categories of anti-epileptic medications. * **Angioedema:** Post-marketing surveillance reported incidences of angioedema during the course of Phenytoin therapy. In the event of facial puffiness, the patients should seek immediate medical guidance from the concerned doctor regarding the cessation of Phenytoin therapy. * **Familial Susceptibility to Drug Allergy:** Patients with an obvious family history of exaggerated reactivity to certain other anticonvulsant drugs (that elicit structural resemblance with Phenytoin sodium) are susceptible to reflecting an allergic response upon Phenytoin therapy. * **Liver Toxicity:** Long-term therapy using Phenytoin can potentially impair the functions of the liver, giving rise to various liver problems, like

obvious family history of exaggerated reactivity to certain other anticonvulsant drugs (that elicit structural resemblance with Phenytoin sodium) are susceptible to reflecting an allergic response upon Phenytoin therapy. * **Liver Toxicity:** Long-term therapy using Phenytoin can potentially impair the functions of the liver, giving rise to various liver problems, like hepatomegaly, liver failure, and jaundice. It can even bring about fatal liver conditions. Also, impaired liver functioning gears down the metabolism of Phenytoin, which in turn enhances the drugâ€™s concentration in the blood. * **Heart Issues:** Phenytoin therapy enhances the susceptibility for heart failure when advised to patients with existing heart conditions. * **Blood Cell Count Discrepancies:** Pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia are also precipitated during Phenytoin therapy. Hence, periodic monitoring of the blood picture is crucial to keep track of discrepancies in the blood cell count. * **Impact on Bone:** Phenytoin interferes with the processing of vitamin D in the body. Under the influence of Phenytoin, vitamin D metabolism gears up, which eventually gives rise to vitamin D deficiency. Depreciation in vitamin D is reflected in bone health in the form of collapsed bone density. Vitamin D deficiency is often associated with hypocalcemia. * **Worsen Porphyria:** Phenytoin is capable of aggravating porphyria. Therefore, while advising Phenytoin therapy to patients diagnosed with porphyria, patients should be forewarned about the risk of porphyria exacerbation and necessary preventive measures should be taken to tackle the condition. * **Psychosis:** An appreciable hike in the Phenytoinâ€™s concentration beyond the pharmacological limit can bring

capable of aggravating porphyria. Therefore, while advising Phenytoin therapy to patients diagnosed with porphyria, patients should be forewarned about the risk of porphyria exacerbation and necessary preventive measures should be taken to tackle the condition. * **Psychosis:** An appreciable hike in the Phenytoinâ€™s concentration beyond the pharmacological limit can bring in a state of psychosis. * **Enhanced Blood Sugar Level:** Phenytoin can hamper the effects of insulin, which in turn gives rise to hyperglycemia. ## What Are the Drug Interactions of Phenytoin Sodium? Phenytoin sodium tends to elicit interactions with a wide spectrum of medicines. * Simultaneous intake of Phenytoin with medicines like Ethosuximide, Topiramate, Fluconazole, Fluoxetine, Fluorouracil, Cimetidine, Sulfadiazine, Warfarin, or Amiodarone potentiates the Phenytoinâ€™s concentration in the blood. It poses the risk of toxicity issues. * Phenytoinâ€™s interaction with drugs like Bleomycin, Ritonavir, Carbamazepine, and antacids brings about a remarkable collapse in Phenytoinâ€™s concentration, making it less effective. * Valproic acid, Valproate sodium, and Phenobarbital are certain other anticonvulsants that are capable of altering the concentration of Phenytoin when taken concurrently with Phenytoin. * Simultaneous therapy using Phenytoin also collapses the potency of other drugs like Ketoconazole, Paclitaxel, Delavirdine, Pancuronium, Warfarin, and Rifampin. This interaction makes those medicines ineffective. * Association with Phenytoin depletes the serum concentration of drugs like Atorvastatin, Carbamazepine, Ritonavir, Nifedipine, and Albendazole. As a result, the intended action of these drugs will be compromised considerably. **Specific Considerations:** * **Phenytoin Sodium During Pregnancy:** Phenytoin can induce teratogenic effects on the developing fetus.

As a result, the intended action of these drugs will be compromised considerably. **Specific Considerations:** * **Phenytoin Sodium During Pregnancy:** Phenytoin can induce teratogenic effects on the developing fetus. There are frequent reports of birth defects, malformations, and congenital syndrome in women who underwent Phenytoin therapy during conception. Fetal hydantoin syndrome is the widely reported birth defect precipitated by maternal intake of antiepileptic medicine during conception. Hence, expectant mothers are strictly advised to refrain from consuming antiepileptic medicines. * **Phenytoin Sodium During Lactation:** Clinical evidence exposed the transmission of Phenytoin into the babyâ€™s body through breastmilk when consumed by a lactating mother. Hence, it is not advisable for a lactating mother. * **Phenytoin Sodium for Geriatric Patients:** Geriatric patients have compromised kidney and liver functions; hence, the dosing frequency needs to be curbed to mitigate toxicity issues. </content> </article> <article> <slug>autoimmune-epilepsy</slug> <content>**Introduction** The immune system defends the body against illness and infection by fighting off invaders like viruses and bacteria. Since germs are not a part of the body, the immune system can identify them and eliminates them. In autoimmune diseases, the immune system unintentionally targets healthy cells in the organs and tissues. Autoimmune disorders frequently run in families. Some individuals may be predisposed to issues due to particular genes. If a person already has the genes for an autoimmune disease, viruses, chemicals, and other environmental factors may cause it to manifest.

immune system unintentionally targets healthy cells in the organs and tissues. Autoimmune disorders frequently run in families. Some individuals may be predisposed to issues due to particular genes. If a person already has the genes for an autoimmune disease, viruses, chemicals, and other environmental factors may cause it to manifest. When the brain activity is abnormal, seizures or periods of strange behavior, sensations, and occasionally loss of awareness result. This condition is known as epilepsy, which is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder. ## What Is Autoimmune Epilepsy? Autoimmune epilepsy, in simple words, is a seizure disorder in which a pathogenic antibody specific to the nervous system is present and may cause seizures. There is a presence of actively circulating antibodies against the nervous system, which points to an autoimmune origin of this condition. Antigens inside or on the surface of neural cells (cells in the brain) may be the target of these antibodies. ## What Are the Causes of Autoimmune Epilepsy? The causes of autoimmune epilepsy are listed below: * Any medication has the potential to generate an autoimmune drug reaction. * The autoimmune disease runs in the family. Certain illnesses are inherited; they run in families. * Smoking. * Having already developed an autoimmune disease. There is a likelihood of getting another one. * Exposure to toxic substances. * Autoimmune disease patients are overwhelmingly female (78 percent). * Obesity. * Infections. ## What Are the Risk Factors of Autoimmune Epilepsy?

* Having already developed an autoimmune disease. There is a likelihood of getting another one. * Exposure to toxic substances. * Autoimmune disease patients are overwhelmingly female (78 percent). * Obesity. * Infections. ## What Are the Risk Factors of Autoimmune Epilepsy? The risk factors of autoimmune epilepsy include those who have: * A past diagnosis of another autoimmune disorder like lupus (immune system attack causing organ inflammation). * A history of cancer. * A close relative (parent, sibling, or child) who suffers from an autoimmune condition. * A sudden and severe increase in seizures is another sign that epilepsy may be autoimmune in origin. ## What Are the Symptoms of Autoimmune Epilepsy? * Seizures occur multiple times throughout the day. * Occurrence of focal seizures (seizures that start in one area of the brain and spread to other areas). * Occurrence of facial brachial dystonic seizures (FBDS), also known as facial brachial dystonic epilepsy, are seizures that affect the same side of the face and arm on the same side of the body. * Seizure medications do not effectively control these seizures. * People may experience memory issues, personality changes, and changes in mood or behavior (hallucinations, depression, or paranoia). Seek emergency medical help in case of the following: * A seizure last five minutes or longer. * A person is not regaining consciousness. * One seizure is followed immediately by another. * Seizures happen more frequently and closer together. * It becomes difficult to breathe, or the person

Seek emergency medical help in case of the following: * A seizure last five minutes or longer. * A person is not regaining consciousness. * One seizure is followed immediately by another. * Seizures happen more frequently and closer together. * It becomes difficult to breathe, or the person seems to be choking. ## How Is Autoimmune Epilepsy Diagnosed? The diagnosis of autoimmune epilepsy is made in the ways listed below: * **Neurological Assessment** \- The doctor may perform tests to identify the type of epilepsy and diagnose the condition and assess the behavior, motor skills, mental function, and other aspects. * **Blood Test** \- In order to look for infections, genetic disorders, or other conditions that might be linked to seizures, the doctor may request a sample of blood. * **Electroencephalogram (EEG)** -The procedure used to identify epilepsy is an electroencephalogram. With the help of a paste-like substance or cap, electrodes are affixed to the scalp for this test. The electrodes capture the brain's electrical activity. Even when not having a seizure, epilepsy patients frequently experience changes in their typical pattern of brain waves. When performing an EEG, awake or asleep, the doctor may videotape the procedure in order to document any seizure episodes. The doctor may be able to identify the type of seizures. * **Computer Tomography (CT) Scan** \- X-rays are used in a CT scan to produce cross-sectional images of the brain. CT scans can detect tumors, bleeding, and cysts, as well as other structural

order to document any seizure episodes. The doctor may be able to identify the type of seizures. * **Computer Tomography (CT) Scan** \- X-rays are used in a CT scan to produce cross-sectional images of the brain. CT scans can detect tumors, bleeding, and cysts, as well as other structural abnormalities in the brain that may be the root cause of seizures. * **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** \- The MRI scan uses magnetic resonance to produce a detailed brain image; an MRI uses strong magnets and radio waves. The doctor might be able to identify brain lesions or other anomalies that could be the root cause of seizures. * **Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan** \- A small amount of low-dose radioactive material is injected into a vein during a PET scan to help visualize the brain's metabolic activity and find anomalies. Low metabolic brain regions may be a sign of seizure activity. * **Examinations of the Brain** \- Doctors evaluate the thinking, memory, and communication abilities during these tests. The test results assist doctors in identifying the parts of the brain that are affected. ## What Is the Treatment of Autoimmune Epilepsy? Medication is typically the first line of treatment for epilepsy for doctors. Doctors may suggest surgery or an alternative form of treatment if medications are unable to manage the condition. * **Medication** \- The majority of people with epilepsy can go seizure-free by taking one anti-seizure medication, also known as an anti-epileptic drug. By using a combination of

for epilepsy for doctors. Doctors may suggest surgery or an alternative form of treatment if medications are unable to manage the condition. * **Medication** \- The majority of people with epilepsy can go seizure-free by taking one anti-seizure medication, also known as an anti-epileptic drug. By using a combination of medications, some people may be able to lessen the frequency and severity of their seizures. In the case of autoimmune epilepsy, immunosuppressants and corticosteroids (Prednisone or Methylprednisolone) may be given to reduce the immune system's attack on the body. * **Surgery** \- Surgery may be an option if medication-only treatment is ineffective in controlling seizures. The part of the brain that is causing seizures is removed during epilepsy surgery. * **Vagus Nerve Stimulation** \- In vagus nerve (nerve carrying signals from organs to the brain) stimulation, a device called a vagus nerve stimulator is implanted beneath the chest skin, much like a heart pacemaker. The neck's vagus nerve is attached to wires coming from the stimulator. The battery-operated gadget delivers brief electrical shocks to the brain via the vagus nerve. The mechanism by which this prevents seizures is unclear, but it typically reduces seizures by 20 to 40 %. * **Ketogenic Diet** \- Following a strict diet that is high in fats and low in carbohydrates has helped some epileptic children experience fewer seizures. The body uses fats for energy instead of carbohydrates when following this diet, known as the ketogenic diet. Some kids might be able to discontinue the

**Ketogenic Diet** \- Following a strict diet that is high in fats and low in carbohydrates has helped some epileptic children experience fewer seizures. The body uses fats for energy instead of carbohydrates when following this diet, known as the ketogenic diet. Some kids might be able to discontinue the ketogenic diet after a few years and continue to have no seizures, provided they do so under the close supervision of their doctors. * **Deep-Brain Stimulation** \- Deep-brain stimulation involves the surgical implantation of electrodes into a particular area of the brain, usually the thalamus. A generator that is implanted in the chest is connected to the electrodes. The generator periodically delivers timed electrical pulses to the brain, which may lessen the seizure frequency. When medication for seizures does not work, deep brain stimulation is frequently used. * **Sensitive Neurostimulation** \- These pacemaker-like, implantable devices can significantly lower the frequency of seizures. When a seizure begins, these responsive stimulation devices analyze brain activity patterns to identify it and deliver a drug or electrical charge to stop the seizure before it impairs function. According to research, this treatment can prevent seizures permanently and has few side effects. ## What Are the Complications of Autoimmune Epilepsy? Autoimmune epilepsy can have the following complication: * Learning difficulties. * A seizure can cause aspiration pneumonia if the sufferer inhales food or saliva into their lungs. * Injury from slips, knocks, self-inflicted bites, driving, or operating machinery while having a seizure. * Stroke or other

Complications of Autoimmune Epilepsy? Autoimmune epilepsy can have the following complication: * Learning difficulties. * A seizure can cause aspiration pneumonia if the sufferer inhales food or saliva into their lungs. * Injury from slips, knocks, self-inflicted bites, driving, or operating machinery while having a seizure. * Stroke or other types of permanent brain injury. * Medication side effects. ## How to Prevent Autoimmune Epilepsy? Autoimmune epilepsy can be prevented in the following ways: * Prevent traumatic brain injuries. * Avoid getting infections. * Eat properly washed and cooked food. * Do deworming of the body regularly. * Do exercise regularly. * Eat a well-balanced diet. * Avoid alcohol and smoking. **Conclusion** Epilepsy, also referred to as seizure disorder, is a common brain disorder that results in frequent seizures. Numerous conditions that have an impact on the brain can lead to epilepsy. Examples include stroke, head injury, complications during childbirth, infections (like meningitis or cysticercosis), and some genetic disorders. Frequently, no clear reason can be identified. Epilepsy that is caused due to the immune system attacking the body is called autoimmune epilepsy. People having autoimmune epilepsy have seizures several times a day. Immunotherapy is very successful in treating autoimmune epilepsy. The inflammation in the brain can be treated with immunotherapy. Steroids like Prednisone or Methylprednisolone, administered orally or intravenously (IV), are frequently used as a treatment.

It is available as an oral tablet and an oral suspension. It acts by inhibiting the sodium channels, thereby preventing the high-frequency firing in the neurons responsible for seizure episodes. The United State Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Oxcarbazepine for the treatment of seizures in 1999. The off-label indications of the drug include maintenance of neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus and treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. The drug has been reported to cause myelosuppression (suppression of the bone marrow to make sufficient blood cells) and hyponatremia (low sodium levels) in some patients. While taking this medication, check for symptoms like extreme paleness, fatigue, shortness of breath, seizures, restlessness, and severe headache, and seek immediate professional help for the required medical intervention. Alcohol use should be limited while taking Oxcarbazepine due to the potential risk of additive sedation. ## How Does Oxcarbazepine Work? Oxcarbazepine is classified under the group of medications called anticonvulsants. It decreases the frequency of multiple firing in neurons, thus eliciting a calming effect by decreasing the irregular electrical activity in the brain's nerve cells. **Dosage:** * Oxcarbazepine is available as 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg immediate-release, and extended-release tablets. * For

under the group of medications called anticonvulsants. It decreases the frequency of multiple firing in neurons, thus eliciting a calming effect by decreasing the irregular electrical activity in the brain's nerve cells. **Dosage:** * Oxcarbazepine is available as 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg immediate-release, and extended-release tablets. * For seizures, the initial dosing of Oxcarbazepine is 600 mg/day on an empty stomach (one hour before or two hours after food) for extended-release tablets and starting with 300 mg/day for immediate-release tablets. * The physician will adjust the dose based on the response to the treatment after the start of the therapy. * Patients are advised to limit the use of alcohol as it may increase sedation for immediate-release tablets. * In case of any queries or doubts, contact the doctor or pharmacist promptly. ## What Are the Drug Warnings for Oxcarbazepine? * **Hyponatremia:** Oxcarbazepine may cause a decline in the sodium levels in the blood. The symptoms include headache, seizures, fainting, etc. These symptoms should be immediately brought to the physician's notice for the necessary treatment. * **Dermatological Reactions:** Oxcarbazepine can lead to serious skin reactions like Steven-Johnsons syndrome, which can be life-threatening. The drug may be discontinued if the symptoms recur on re-administration. * **Mood Changes:** Oxcarbazepine can worsen various psychiatric conditions like anxiety and depression and cause rapid behavior changes. * **Risk of Aggravation of Seizures:** Oxcarbazepine may lead to worsening seizures in some individuals. This should be reported to the doctor at the earliest. * **Pregnancy:**

This should be reported to the doctor at the earliest. * **Pregnancy:** Talk to the doctor if the patient is pregnant or intends to get pregnant before taking the medication. ## For Patients: **What Is Partial Seizure?** Seizures are a sudden surge of electrical activity in the brain. It can cause convulsions, loss of consciousness, and muscle spasms. The most common type of seizure is a partial (focal) seizure, which can affect one or more areas on either side of the brain. Partial seizures can be focal aware or focal impaired, depending on whether the person experiencing it knows what is happening during their seizure or not. Partial seizures are usually short in duration and may cause physical symptoms such as twitching, shaking, jerking, loss of awareness, or speech difficulties. The causes and symptoms vary depending on which area(s) of the seizure affects the brain. For example, if an epileptic has right temporal lobe epilepsy may experience hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms such as paranoia. If an epileptic has left temporal lobe epilepsy, they may experience language problems and difficulty with memory retention. Treatment for seizures is different for everyone depending on the cause and severity. If a seizure is not treated properly, it can lead to serious health problems like coma

such as paranoia. If an epileptic has left temporal lobe epilepsy, they may experience language problems and difficulty with memory retention. Treatment for seizures is different for everyone depending on the cause and severity. If a seizure is not treated properly, it can lead to serious health problems like coma or death. **Learn More About Oxcarbazepine:** **Before Starting Oxcarbazepine:** **When and Why to Take Oxcarbazepine?** Oxcarbazepine is a prescription medication used to control seizures. It should be taken as per the doctor's order. ## What are the Things to Inform The Doctor Before Taking Prescribe Oxcarbazepine? Inform the doctor if any of the following conditions are present: * Previous history of allergy to any drug or components of the medication. * If the patient has any liver diseases, the doses need to be adjusted. * Have kidney diseases which are particularly associated with reduced levels of sodium in the blood. * Taking any medications that can lower the sodium levels in the body, like Desmopressin, Indomethacin, Ibuprofen, or drugs belonging to the diuretic class. * Have heart diseases like heart failure, changes in heart rhythm, or if the patient experiences breathlessness or swollen legs. * Oxcarbazepine can also result in a decrease in thyroid levels in some patients. Check the thyroid levels regularly, especially in children. * If the patient is using hormonal contraceptives. **Starting Oxcarbazepine:** ## How Is Oxcarbazepine Given? The starting dose is 300 mg daily for immediate-release tablets and 600 mg for extended-release tablets. The doctor may

Check the thyroid levels regularly, especially in children. * If the patient is using hormonal contraceptives. **Starting Oxcarbazepine:** ## How Is Oxcarbazepine Given? The starting dose is 300 mg daily for immediate-release tablets and 600 mg for extended-release tablets. The doctor may adjust the dose if any other anticonvulsant drug is given. Follow the instructions carefully. The extended- release tablets should be taken on an empty stomach. **Things to Do After Starting Oxcarbazepine:** Oxcarbazepine administered can result in side effects. It is important to follow up with the doctor to assess the progress of the treatment and to see if any side effects are experienced. If the frequency of the seizures is reduced, the doctor must be notified to make the necessary changes in the drug dose. ## What Are the Side Effects of Oxcarbazepine? The side effects of Oxcarbazepine include: **Common:** * Tiredness. * Shortness of breath, especially during physical activity. * Headache. * Chills. * Infections leading to fever. * Dizziness. * Easy bruising or bleeding. * Sore throat. * Mouth ulcer. * Reddish or purplish patches and unexplained blotches on the skin. The more severe side effects of the medication include: * Severe mood changes and self-harming ideation in some individuals. * Life-threatening conditions like Steven Johnson's syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis are presented with extreme rash or discolored scars on the skin, ulcers in the nose, mouth, and genitals, and blistering the skin. * Oxcarbazepine can also result

Avoid the consumption of alcohol-containing food or beverages while taking this medication. Some formulations of Oxcarbazepine contain lactose as an inactive ingredient. Patients with lactose intolerance should inform the doctor before taking the medication. If the patient is taking medications for other conditions, inform the doctor of all the prescriptions, non-prescription, and supplements before taking the medication. Follow the instructions as advised. **What Should Be Done if a Dose Is Missed?** If a dose is missed, take it as soon as it is remembered and continue with the normal dosing regimen. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the previous one and continue as scheduled. Avoid taking double doses to make up for a missed dose. In case of queries, contact the pharmacist or the doctor. **What Should Be Done to Treat Oxcarbazepine Overdose?** Avoid taking the tablet more than the advised dosage.

of Action:** The exact mechanism by which Oxcarbazepine exerts its anticonvulsant effect is unknown. It is known that the pharmacological activity of Oxcarbazepine occurs primarily through its 10-monohydroxy metabolite (MHD). Studies conducted in vitro show that MHD causes the blocking of voltage-sensitive sodium channels, stabilizes hyper-excited neuronal membranes, prevents recurrent neuronal discharges, and slows synaptic impulse propagation. **Pharmacodynamics:** Oxcarbazepine and its active metabolite have anticonvulsant effects in animal seizure models. They eliminated or significantly decreased the incidence of continuously recurring focal seizures in Rhesus monkeys with aluminum implants, as well as provided protection against electrically generated tonic extension seizures in rodents and, to a lesser extent, chemically induced clonic seizures. **Absorption:** Patients receiving twice-daily Oxcarbazepine reach steady-state plasma concentrations of MHD in two to three days. Over the dose range of 300 to 2400 mg/day, the pharmacokinetics of MHD are linear and exhibit dose proportionality at a steady state. **Distribution:** MHD is mostly linked to albumin in serum proteins, where it occupies a 40 % binding capacity. Within the therapeutically relevant range, binding is not reliant on serum concentration. Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein is not bindable to Oxcarbazepine or MHD. It has a volume of distribution of 49 L. **Metabolism:** Cytosolic enzymes primarily reduce Oxcarbazepine into its active metabolite. It is then further metabolized by glucuronic acid conjugation. **Excretion:** Oxcarbazepine is excreted as metabolites that are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. Less than one percent of the dose is found as unaltered Oxcarbazepine, with more than 95 % of the dose excreted

It is then further metabolized by glucuronic acid conjugation. **Excretion:** Oxcarbazepine is excreted as metabolites that are primarily eliminated by the kidneys. Less than one percent of the dose is found as unaltered Oxcarbazepine, with more than 95 % of the dose excreted in the urine. Less than four percent of the dosage given is excreted in the feces. **Toxicity:** **Non-Clinical Toxicology:** * **Carcinogenesis:** Rats exposed to 250 mg/kg/day of Oxcarbazepine and 250 mg/kg/day of MHD saw an increase in the incidence of benign testicular interstitial cell tumors, whereas rats exposed to 600 mg/kg/day of MHD experienced an increase in the incidence of granular cell tumors in the cervix and vagina. * **Mutagenicity:** No mutagenic effects were observed in animal studies of Oxcarbazepine. * **Impairment in Fertility:** In a fertility trial, rats were given MHD (50, 150, or 450 mg/kg) orally before and during mating and early gestation. The highest dose interrupted estrous cyclicity and decreased the number of corpora lutea, implantations, and viable embryos in the females. **Clinical Toxicity:** * **Management of Mild to Moderate Toxicity:** Supportive and symptomatic care is provided. Use IV (intravenous) fluids to treat mild hypotension. Use 0.9 % sodium chloride and water restriction to treat mild hyponatremia. * **Management of Severe Toxicity:** Supportive and symptomatic care are provided. Administer IV fluids, Dopamine, or Norepinephrine to treat severe hypotension. Use IV benzodiazepines to treat seizures; barbiturates or Propofol may be required if they last or recur.

Administer IV fluids, Dopamine, or Norepinephrine to treat severe hypotension. Use IV benzodiazepines to treat seizures; barbiturates or Propofol may be required if they last or recur. Oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, Diphenhydramine, corticosteroids, vasopressors, and Epinephrine, may be necessary for patients who are experiencing an acute allergic reaction. Use 0.9 % sodium chloride to treat severe hyponatremia; 3 % sodium chloride may be used for extremely symptomatic hyponatremia. **Warnings and Precautions:** * **Beers Criteria:** When taken for epilepsy or mood disorders, older persons with a history of falls or fractures should avoid using it because it may result in syncope, reduced psychomotor function, or ataxia. Avoid using three or more CNS-active medications simultaneously in any combination due to the increased risk of falling. Use caution if prescribed since SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion) or hyponatremia could develop or worsen; keep an eye on the sodium levels when starting or changing doses. * **Dermatologic Reactions:** If severe dermatological reactions occur (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis), which could be fatal or life-threatening. Test at-risk patients for HLA-B*1502 and, if present, avoid use unless benefits clearly outweigh risks. Patients with the HLA-B*1502 (most prevalent in Chinese, Thai, Filipino, Malaysian, Korean, and eastern Indian populations) have an increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. * **Metabolic Changes:** Monitoring is advised.

if present, avoid use unless benefits clearly outweigh risks. Patients with the HLA-B*1502 (most prevalent in Chinese, Thai, Filipino, Malaysian, Korean, and eastern Indian populations) have an increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. * **Metabolic Changes:** Monitoring is advised. Clinically severe hyponatremia (sodium less than 120 mmol/L) and SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion) may occur, particularly during the first three months of medication and more than one year after therapy commencement. T4 levels might drop without corresponding T3 or TSH drops. Dose interruption or withdrawal may be required. * **Hematologic:** If hematological reactions, including pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and leukopenia, have been reported, discontinue use. * **Hepatic:** Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not use extended-release tablets, and immediate-release forms should be used with care. * **Hypersensitivity:** Increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction in patients who have previously had hypersensitivity to Carbamazepine (about 25 % to 30 % will do so with Oxcarbazepine); use only if the potential benefit outweighs the risk; stop using immediately if hypersensitivity signs or symptoms appear. Drug responses with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) or multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions have happened; if this has happened, stop using the drug immediately. There have been fatal cases of angioedema and anaphylaxis of the larynx, glottis, lips, and eyelids; urgent and permanent withdrawal is advised in such cases. * **Neurologic:** Adverse cognitive and neuropsychiatric events, such as psychomotor retardation, concentration problems, speech or language issues, sleepiness or weariness, or atypical coordination (such as ataxia and gait impairments),

Quick discontinuation may be considered if the withdrawal is required owing to a major adverse event. Avoid rapid withdrawal, as this may increase seizure frequency and the risk of status epilepticus. It has been observed that primary generalized seizures can develop suddenly or worsen; if this happens, stop taking the medication. * **Reproductive:** Non-hormonal forms of contraception are advised because therapy may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (extended-release). **Contraindications:** Oxcarbazepine is contraindicated in patients with: * A history of hypersensitivity to the drug or its components. * Concurrent administration with drugs Cabotegravir, Doravirine, and Rilpivirine. **Clinical Studies:** Studies have shown that Oxcarbazepine monotherapy is just as effective at reducing the frequency of generalized tonic-clonic and partial seizures in newly diagnosed adult patients as Phenytoin plus Valproic acid. Oxcarbazepine 2400 mg/day, used as monotherapy, has shown promise in treating adult patients with refractory partial seizures. In 692 individuals with refractory partial seizures, Oxcarbazepine 600, 1200, and 2400 mg/day as an additional therapy significantly decreased seizure frequency compared with a placebo. The effectiveness of Oxcarbazepine monotherapy in treating children and adolescents with newly diagnosed partial or generalized tonic-clonic seizures is comparable to that of Phenytoin.

These seizures occur due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain, resulting in sudden, involuntary movements, changes in behavior, or loss of consciousness. One of the less common types of epilepsy is myoclonic epilepsy, which is characterized by brief, involuntary muscle jerks or spasms. ## What Is the Etiology of Myoclonic Epilepsies? The exact cause of myoclonic epilepsy is not fully understood. Studies suggest that it could occur due to genetic mutations that affect the functioning of ion channels in the brain, leading to abnormal electrical activity. Other causes of myoclonic epilepsy may include head injury, brain infection, or brain tumors. ## What Are the Types of Myoclonic Epilepsies? There are several types of myoclonic epilepsy, including: * Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. * Progressive myoclonic epilepsy. * Myoclonic astatic epilepsy. The

the brain, leading to abnormal electrical activity. Other causes of myoclonic epilepsy may include head injury, brain infection, or brain tumors. ## What Are the Types of Myoclonic Epilepsies? There are several types of myoclonic epilepsy, including: * Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. * Progressive myoclonic epilepsy. * Myoclonic astatic epilepsy. The most common is juvenile myoclonic epilepsy which typically begins in adolescence. Progressive myoclonic epilepsy is a rare form of the disorder that is characterized by worsening seizures and neurological symptoms over time. Myoclonic astatic epilepsy, also known as Doose syndrome, is an uncommon type of epilepsy that typically starts in early childhood. ## What Are the Symptoms and Signs of Myoclonic Epilepsies? There are some common signs and symptoms seen in the case of myoclonic epilepsies. Here are a few of the following: * **Sudden Muscle Jerks or Twitches** : These can occur in one or more body parts. These can be slow or intense. * **Uncontrolled Movements** : Myoclonic seizures can cause sudden, uncontrolled movements that can interfere with daily activities. * **Impaired Consciousness:** Some people with myoclonic epilepsy may experience altered awareness or loss of consciousness during seizures. * **Sensory Disturbances:** Some people may experience changes in vision, hearing, or other sensory experiences during seizures. * **Muscle Weakness:** Some may experience muscle weakness or loss of muscle tone during seizures. * **Fatigue:** Myoclonic seizures can be exhausting and people with this condition may experience fatigue or sleepiness after a seizure. * **Mood Changes** : Some people with myoclonic

hearing, or other sensory experiences during seizures. * **Muscle Weakness:** Some may experience muscle weakness or loss of muscle tone during seizures. * **Fatigue:** Myoclonic seizures can be exhausting and people with this condition may experience fatigue or sleepiness after a seizure. * **Mood Changes** : Some people with myoclonic epilepsy may experience changes in mood, such as anxiety or depression. ## How Is It Diagnosed? Diagnosis of myoclonic epilepsy is typically based on a combination of clinical history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing. The doctor may order an electroencephalogram (EEG) to measure the brain's electrical activity during a seizure. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan may also be ordered to rule out other causes of seizures, such as brain tumors or infections. ## What Is the Treatment for Myoclonic Epilepsies? Treatment for myoclonic epilepsy typically involves antiepileptic medication to control seizures. Medications such as Valproic acid, Lamotrigine, and Levetiracetam are commonly used to treat myoclonic epilepsy. In some cases, a combination of medications may be necessary to achieve seizure control. For those who do not respond to medication, surgery may be an option to remove the part of the brain responsible for seizures. ## How to Prevent Myoclonic Epilepsy or Reduce the Risk of Having Them? Unfortunately, there is no guaranteed way to prevent myoclonic epilepsy, as the condition is often caused by genetic factors or underlying neurological conditions. However, there are some steps that may help to reduce the risk of seizures or manage symptoms: * **Medication:** Antiepileptic

or Reduce the Risk of Having Them? Unfortunately, there is no guaranteed way to prevent myoclonic epilepsy, as the condition is often caused by genetic factors or underlying neurological conditions. However, there are some steps that may help to reduce the risk of seizures or manage symptoms: * **Medication:** Antiepileptic medications helps to reduce the frequency and severity of seizures. It is important to work with a healthcare provider to find the right medication and dosage. * **Lifestyle Changes:** Certain lifestyle changes, such as getting enough sleep, reducing stress, avoiding triggers such as alcohol or caffeine, and following a healthy diet and exercise routine, may help to reduce the risk of seizures. * **Get Enough Sleep:** Lack of sleep or poor quality of sleep can trigger seizures in some people. Adequate amount of sleep of seven to eight hours, and creating a consistent sleep routine will help. * **Manage Stress:** Stress can also trigger seizures in some people. Reduce stress by getting into meditation or yoga with a certified trainer. * **Avoid Triggers:** Some people with myoclonic epilepsy have specific triggers that can cause seizures, such as flashing lights or certain types of music. Avoid these triggers if possible. * **Cognitive and Behavioral Therapies:** Therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. * **Surgery:** In some cases, surgery may be an option to remove a specific area of the brain that is causing seizures. * **Seizure Response Plan:** Developing a plan for

**Do Not Restrain the Person:** Avoid holding the person down or restraining them during the seizure. Allow the seizure to run its course. * **Time of the Seizure:** Note the time the seizure starts and ends. If the seizure continues for over 5 minutes or the person has difficulty breathing, call for emergency medical assistance immediately. * **Turn the Person to Their Side:** After the seizure is over, turn the person onto their side to prevent choking and ensure that their airway is clear. * **Reassure the Person:** After the seizure, the person may feel confused or disoriented. Reassure them and provide emotional support. * **Seek Medical Attention:** If the person is injured, has difficulty breathing, or has a prolonged seizure, seek emergency medical attention immediately. It is important to remember that every person with myoclonic epilepsy is different, and they may have different needs and preferences during and after a seizure. It is important to work with the person and their healthcare provider to develop a personalized seizure management plan. **Conclusion:** In conclusion, myoclonic epilepsy is a type of epilepsy characterized by sudden, involuntary muscle jerks or spasms. It can be caused by genetic mutations or other factors that affect the function of ion channels in the brain.

This drug can be less dangerous than other drugs when it comes to mental illness. The healing of migraine, seizures, and epilepsy are notable positive effects. The advantageous effect of this drug for epilepsy makes this drug get the name of the group as an anti-epileptic drug. ## How Does Divalproex Sodium Work? Divalproex Sodium is a compound that contains sodium valproate and valproic acid. Bipolar disorder, migraines, seizures, and other disorders that are related to mental health have one thing in common. It is a reduction in the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid. This amino acid component acts as a neurotransmitter in the brain. This neurotransmitter helps in maintaining the proper functioning and excitability of the neurons in the brain. It mainly acts by inhibiting the excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain. Any derangement in the levels of Divalproex sodium can cause a certain degree of unhappy feeling. The ease of the patient might be lost in some patients. So, it is necessary that the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid should be present in the correct levels. The medications, such as Divalproex Sodium that are given to enhance the depressive states and manic episodes. **Onset Of Action:** The onset of actions varies depending on the route of administration.

behavior or seizure and loss of awareness is called epilepsy. Depending on the type of seizure, the symptoms can vary. The signs and symptoms of seizures include confusion, and muscle stiffness, jerking, uncontrolled movements, loss of awareness or consciousness. ## Which Are the Types of Epilepsy? There are mainly two types of seizures. And among them, it has many different variations of seizures. They include: * **Focal Seizures -** Focal seizures without loss of consciousness will not affect consciousness. It can affect emotion, smell, taste, sound, or feeling. People having focal seizures without loss of consciousness can experience Deja Vu. It can also result in involuntary body jerking, like legs or arms, and some sensory symptoms, like dizziness and tingling. The other type of seizure is focal seizure with impaired awareness, also called complex partial seizure which includes loss of awareness or consciousness. During the seizure, a person will stare into a point or space. People with focus with impaired awareness do not respond normally and can perform property movements like chewing, swallowing, and hand rubbing. * **Generalized Seizures -** They include absence seizures or petit mal seizures, which are usually seen in children. It is characterized by steering at a point without any movement of the body, like blinking of the eye, and it can only last for ten seconds. Tonics seizures can result in stiffness of the muscles and can also affect consciousness. Atonic seizures or drop seizures can cause reduced muscle control. Clonic seizures are associated with

a point without any movement of the body, like blinking of the eye, and it can only last for ten seconds. Tonics seizures can result in stiffness of the muscles and can also affect consciousness. Atonic seizures or drop seizures can cause reduced muscle control. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated muscle jerking. Myoclonic seizures can occur as sudden jerky movements or twitches. Tonic-clonic or grand mal seizures can cause stiffening of the body and loss of consciousness. ## What Are the Natural Treatment Methods for Epilepsy? Natural methods of treating epilepsy include the following: * **Herbal Treatment Methods -** Most herbs help treat various types of diseases and symptoms. Herbal medicine helps in balancing the neurotransmitters present in the brain. It helps prevent nerve inflammation and helps in the dysfunction of the mitochondria. Burning bush, hydrocoele, mistletoe, peony, skullcap, valerian, groundsel, lily of the valley, mugwort, and tree of heaven are some of the herbs that help in the treatment of epilepsy and also reduce symptoms. Some herbs can also worsen the symptoms of epilepsy which include garlic, chamomile, schizandra, caffeine, passion flower, kava, kola, mint tea, and guarana. So these herbs should be avoided to prevent the worsening of epilepsy. * **Vitamin B6 -** Some vitamins help in decreasing the frequency and intensity of seizures caused by certain types of epilepsy. Vitamin B6 helps in treating pyridoxine-dependent seizures. This epilepsy usually develops in the womb or immediately after birth. This seizure is caused by the body's failure to

of epilepsy. * **Vitamin B6 -** Some vitamins help in decreasing the frequency and intensity of seizures caused by certain types of epilepsy. Vitamin B6 helps in treating pyridoxine-dependent seizures. This epilepsy usually develops in the womb or immediately after birth. This seizure is caused by the body's failure to metabolize vitamin B6. * **Magnesium -** Magnesium deficiency can result in seizures and has high epilepsy risk. Magnesium supplements can help in reducing epilepsy and seizures. * **Vitamin E -** Vitamin E deficiency can also result in seizures and epilepsy. Vitamin E has antioxidant properties. * **Other Vitamins -** The epilepsy medication can result in Vitamin D or biotin deficiency, worsening the symptoms of seizures. * **Dietary Changes -** Dietary changes can help reduce epilepsy and the symptoms associated with epilepsy. A ketogenic diet, or eating high amounts of fat with low protein and low carb, is the best diet for reducing seizures and epilepsy. Various studies show that changing the diet to ketogenic helps decrease the symptoms of epilepsy and seizures. * **Biofeedback and Self Control -** Controlling the brain's activities helps reduce epilepsy and seizures in some people. Most people will experience some symptoms for 20 minutes before seizures. The symptoms include foul smell, seeing strange lighting, or blurred vision. These will lead to other mental and physical problems like stress, anxiety, depression, headache, and fatigue. Self-controlling helps to decrease or prevent the intensity of epilepsy and seizures. These self-control methods require very good focus and concentration. Some

Self-controlling helps to decrease or prevent the intensity of epilepsy and seizures. These self-control methods require very good focus and concentration. Some of the self-control methods that help in preventing or reducing epilepsy are by focusing on meditation, walking, smelling a strong odor, or involving in a task. Biofeedback is similar to the self-control method. It also controls the activities of the brain. They use electrical sensors to change brain waves. A study has shown that biofeedback effectively reduced the symptoms of epilepsy and seizures when the medications were not working. * **Chiropractic Care and Acupuncture -** These methods are considered an alternative to standard epilepsy treatment. Acupuncture helps reduce chronic pain and various other conditions with the help of hair-thin needles inserted into specific areas of the body. Acupuncture can help in changing the activities of the brain by increasing the activities of the parasympathetic nervous system. In chiropractic care, spinal manipulation will help heal the body and also help control seizures and epilepsy. * **Vagus Nerve Stimulation -** The vagus nerve is stimulated by implanting a device that helps send electrical signals to the brain, which helps reduce epilepsy and symptoms associated with seizures. * **Relaxation -** Stress, anxiety, and depression can increase the chances of seizures and epilepsy. Reducing stress and anxiety helps calm the mind and body, relax

nerve is stimulated by implanting a device that helps send electrical signals to the brain, which helps reduce epilepsy and symptoms associated with seizures. * **Relaxation -** Stress, anxiety, and depression can increase the chances of seizures and epilepsy. Reducing stress and anxiety helps calm the mind and body, relax the muscles, and it helps in improving the quality of sleep. Common relaxation techniques used to reduce stress and anxiety include Indian head massage, which includes the massage of shoulders, arms, and head. Full body massage, the shiatsu technique in which pressure is applied on acupuncture points, and reflexology, focusing on pressure points on feet and hands. Meditation and breathing techniques also help relax the mind and body and transfer electrical signals to the brain. * **Avoid Trigger -** A seizure can occur when there's an imbalance in the neurotransmitter level. The neurotransmitter which helps in inhibition is GABA or gamma-aminobutyric acid, and stimulation is glutamate. An imbalance in the neurotransmitters will create a paroxysmal depolarization shift or PDS, resulting in an epileptic activity. Some activities and events can trigger this shift which include sleeplessness, stress, alcohol and drug use flashing lights in case of people having photo-sensitive epilepsy. **Conclusion:** Herbal medicine, vitamins, dietary change, self-control, biofeedback, and acupuncture helps to treat epilepsy and seizures naturally. Different herbs help in treating different types of seizures. Some herbs are even contraindicated in some seizures.

It has long been understood that seizures, which are aberrant electrical discharges in the brain, are largely neurological phenomena. However, new research suggests that seizures can have a significant impact on heart function and cause a variety of arrhythmias. A complex mix of direct and indirect routes underlies the relationship between cardiac arrhythmias and seizures. While indirect consequences result from systemic changes brought on by seizures, direct effects come from changes in the autonomic nervous system's activity. Comprehending the mechanisms underlying seizure-induced cardiac arrhythmias is essential to improving patient care and outcomes. ## What Are Seizure-Induced Cardiac Arrhythmias? Cardiac arrhythmias brought on by seizures are referred to as seizure-induced cardiac arrhythmias. Although seizures are aberrant electrical events in the brain, they can also impact the heartbeat activity. The regular electrical signals that regulate the heart's rhythm can get disrupted during a seizure, resulting in various arrhythmias. These arrhythmias can range from minor palpitations to more serious disruptions that would need medical attention. To avoid potential consequences and guarantee the well-being of people who are having seizures, it is crucial to identify and treat cardiac arrhythmias

rhythm can get disrupted during a seizure, resulting in various arrhythmias. These arrhythmias can range from minor palpitations to more serious disruptions that would need medical attention. To avoid potential consequences and guarantee the well-being of people who are having seizures, it is crucial to identify and treat cardiac arrhythmias brought on by seizures. ## What Are the Causes of Seizure-Induced Cardiac Arrhythmias? The following list of primary causes can be distilled: * **Autonomic Nervous System Imbalance** : Seizures upset the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system's natural equilibrium, causing an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system. This imbalance may cause conduction, contractility, and heart rate abnormalities, which may result in arrhythmias. * **Overactive Sympathetic Nervous System:** Seizures can result in overactive sympathetic nervous system activity, which can increase heart rate, increase contractility, and result in arrhythmias. * **Parasympathetic Withdrawal** : Seizures may cause a decrease in parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) activity, which can cause arrhythmias by upsetting the heart's regular rhythm. * **Hypoxemia:** Seizures can impair breathing and lower blood oxygen levels, which causes hypoxemia. The heart's electrical stability can be harmed, and arrhythmias can be encouraged by insufficient oxygen supply. * **Acidosis** : Excessive lactate generation during seizures might cause acidosis. Acidosis changes the pH balance of the heart and interferes with ion channels, which raises the danger of arrhythmias. * **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Seizures can alter the amounts of electrolytes, including potassium, sodium, and calcium, which are essential for healthy heart function. Electrolyte imbalances may exacerbate arrhythmias.

seizures might cause acidosis. Acidosis changes the pH balance of the heart and interferes with ion channels, which raises the danger of arrhythmias. * **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Seizures can alter the amounts of electrolytes, including potassium, sodium, and calcium, which are essential for healthy heart function. Electrolyte imbalances may exacerbate arrhythmias. ## Can Seizures Lead to Cardiac Arrhythmia? Seizures do not themselves cause cardiac arrhythmias. Certain conditions associated with seizures can lead to cardiac arrhythmia. A deficiency of oxygen to the brain during a seizure activity can lead to cardiac arrhythmia. Certain metabolic disorders and genetic conditions can cause both seizures and cardiac problems. Certain anti-seizure medications may affect the heart rate or heart rhythm. ## Can Heart Problems Cause Seizures? Cardiac problems do not directly cause seizures. In some scenarios, some heart problems are related to seizures. * Syncope (fainting). * A deficiency of oxygen supply to the brain (hypoxia). * Cardiogenic syncope (deficiency of blood flow to the brain). * Arrhythmias. ## How to Diagnose Seizure-Induced Cardiac Arrhythmias? The main steps in detecting seizure-induced cardiac arrhythmias are as follows: * **Medical History Assessment:** A complete assessment of the patient's medical history will be done by the healthcare professional, with special attention paid to any past seizure history, cardiac problems, or symptoms that might indicate arrhythmias during or after seizures. Information on the seizures' frequency, length, and other features must be gathered. * **Physical Examination:** The patient will get a thorough physical examination to determine their overall health, including a

special attention paid to any past seizure history, cardiac problems, or symptoms that might indicate arrhythmias during or after seizures. Information on the seizures' frequency, length, and other features must be gathered. * **Physical Examination:** The patient will get a thorough physical examination to determine their overall health, including a cardiovascular assessment to look for any indications of structural or rhythmic cardiac abnormalities. * **Electrocardiogram (ECG):** An ECG is a key diagnostic tool to assess the heart's electrical activity. It captures the heart's rhythm and can aid in identifying any irregularities or arrhythmias that might manifest before, during, or after a seizure. To record any irregular or intermittent arrhythmias, it may occasionally be necessary to do prolonged or continuous ECG monitoring (heart monitoring or event recording). * **Echocardiogram:** Echocardiography employs ultrasound waves to provide images of the anatomy and operation of the heart. It can assist in locating any structural irregularities or underlying heart issues that might support the emergence of arrhythmias. * **Laboratory Tests** : Blood tests can be performed to check the levels of electrolytes (such as potassium, sodium, and calcium) and other factors that may impact how well the heart works. * **Electrophysiological Investigations:** In some circumstances, electrophysiological investigations may be carried out to evaluate the heart's electrical conduction system thoroughly. Catheters are inserted into the heart as part of these tests to map the electrical pathways that cause arrhythmias, which helps diagnose and choose effective treatments. ## What Is the Treatment Plan For Seizure-Induced Cardiac Arrhythmias?

The following is part of the seizure-induced cardiac arrhythmia treatment plan: * **Antiepileptic Medications** : Controlling seizures using antiepileptic drugs provided by a neurologist or epileptologist is the main goal of seizure management. Effective seizure management can lessen the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias brought on by seizures. * **Cardiac Drugs** : To treat and manage cardiac arrhythmias directly linked to seizures, a cardiologist may prescribe beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics, or calcium channel blockers. * **Cardiac Monitoring:** Modifying one's lifestyle can help lower seizure activity and, subsequently, the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. For example, one might avoid triggers that may cause seizures, such as lack of sleep, stress, and alcohol. * **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS):** For people with refractory seizures and related cardiac arrhythmias, VNS is a therapy option. It entails implanting a device that sends electrical impulses to the vagus nerve, which can assist in lowering the frequency of seizures and the danger of arrhythmias. * **Seizure Detection and Alarm Systems** : Seizure detection and alarm systems can be used for people at high risk of cardiac arrhythmias brought on by seizures. These tools track physiological alterations linked to seizures, such as changes in heart rate or oxygen saturation, and they sound

danger of arrhythmias. * **Seizure Detection and Alarm Systems** : Seizure detection and alarm systems can be used for people at high risk of cardiac arrhythmias brought on by seizures. These tools track physiological alterations linked to seizures, such as changes in heart rate or oxygen saturation, and they sound an alarm to notify caregivers or medical staff. **Conclusion** A multimodal treatment strategy is necessary to manage seizure-induced cardiac arrhythmias to address both the underlying seizure activity and the related cardiac abnormalities. The objective is to stabilize the heart's electrical rhythm while achieving effective seizure control. Antiepileptic drugs are essential for minimizing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and preventing seizures. These drugs are created specifically for the type of seizures the patient experiences, and they can be used in conjunction with antiarrhythmic drugs to target and control irregular heart rhythms. Arrhythmias must be identified and recorded via continuous cardiac monitoring, such as ambulatory ECG monitoring or implanted devices. It ensures prompt action when necessary and aids in guiding treatment decisions. Additionally, seizure detection and warning systems can add extra protection for people at high risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias brought on by seizures, enabling immediate medical help. </content> </article> <article> <slug>nocturnal-frontal-lobe-epilepsy</slug> <content>**Introduction** Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that occurs due to abnormal electrical activity in parts of the brain characterized by seizures, unusual behavior, and sometimes even loss of awareness.

<slug>nocturnal-frontal-lobe-epilepsy</slug> <content>**Introduction** Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that occurs due to abnormal electrical activity in parts of the brain characterized by seizures, unusual behavior, and sometimes even loss of awareness. Two or more seizure episodes without any known trigger and separated by a time interval of at least 24 hours constitute a diagnosis of epilepsy. Epilepsy is classified under two broad categories based on the areas of the brain involved. If seizures arise from one part of the brain, then it is called focal, whereas all the areas of the brain being involved make it generalized. Focal seizures may occur without an alteration in the state of consciousness (simple partial seizures) or involve loss of awareness (earlier known as complex partial seizures). Generalized seizures are further designated into six subtypes - absence; tonic; clonic; myoclonic; atonic and tonic-clonic seizures. ## What Is Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy (NFLE)? It is a form of focal epilepsy resulting from a period of aberrant electrical activity in the frontal lobe of the brain. The frontal lobe is the largest of the four lobes of the brain and is responsible for various important functions such as an individualâ€™s behavior and personality, thinking, learning and remembering (cognitive) abilities, speech, and movement. Hence in addition to seizures, frontal lobe epilepsy has the potential to cause changes in personality and sleep disturbances. It can also occur when one is awake, but more commonly happens when one is sleeping. ## How Common Is NFLE? It comprises about 20 %

(cognitive) abilities, speech, and movement. Hence in addition to seizures, frontal lobe epilepsy has the potential to cause changes in personality and sleep disturbances. It can also occur when one is awake, but more commonly happens when one is sleeping. ## How Common Is NFLE? It comprises about 20 % to 30% of all focal epilepsy cases. It may begin anytime between infancy and adulthood. Individuals with abnormal brain development or other developmental disorders are more susceptible. ## What Causes NFLE? Many cases of NFLE are due to a developmental disturbance in the brain. Sometimes the outermost layer of the brain, called the cortex, does not develop completely. It may also be caused due to brain infections, injury or trauma to brain tissue, and tumors or other lesions of the brain. Experiencing seizures in early childhood increases the chance of NFLE. It can also occur in conjunction with other developmental disabilities. Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) is an inherited form of NFLE that runs in families. A mutation in genes like CHRNA2, CHRNA4, or CHRNB2 can cause ADNFLE. These genetic abnormalities impede the normal uptake and release of neurotransmitters in the brain. It is a very rare condition. ## What Are the Symptoms? An episode of NFLE typically lasts from a few seconds to minutes (5 seconds to 5 minutes). It is preceded by an aura. The aura is characterized by a dizzy feeling like one is falling, tingling or numbness, and loss of balance. Some people also

## What Are the Symptoms? An episode of NFLE typically lasts from a few seconds to minutes (5 seconds to 5 minutes). It is preceded by an aura. The aura is characterized by a dizzy feeling like one is falling, tingling or numbness, and loss of balance. Some people also experience breathlessness or a choking sensation. It serves as a warning sign for an upcoming episode but may not be present in all cases. While some cases are triggered by fatigue or stress, there are no recognizable triggers in most individuals. Symptoms of NFLE include: * Periodic arousal from sleep * Turning the head or eyes to one side * Alarming screams or laughter. Swearing is also common * Kicking or pedaling with oneâ€™s legs * Thrusting the pelvis. * Urinary incontinence (urine is leaked/passed without oneâ€™s control) * Sleep-walking could be a component of NFLE * Thrusting or twitching movements * Abnormal postures such as extension or flexion of arms; repetitive flinging or throwing actions It is common to feel confused or groggy after an episode. When consciousness is retained during an episode, the individual may feel scared to fall asleep, fearing more seizures. Episodes decrease in frequency and intensity with increasing age. Episodes are more likely to occur during Stage 2 (light sleep) of the sleep cycle. ## How Is It Diagnosed? Diagnosis is based on personal history. It is important to evaluate family history since ADNFLE is inherited. The doctor may do neurological testing. Tests to assess

intensity with increasing age. Episodes are more likely to occur during Stage 2 (light sleep) of the sleep cycle. ## How Is It Diagnosed? Diagnosis is based on personal history. It is important to evaluate family history since ADNFLE is inherited. The doctor may do neurological testing. Tests to assess an individualâ€™s brain activity include: * An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan helps visualize the soft tissues of the brain. This can be used to check for the presence of abnormal lesions or tumors or any other damage in the brain. * EEG (Electroencephalography) - It is a test that determines the site of origin of a seizure. It can be used to measure the electrical activity in the brain during a seizure (ictal) or in the time between two seizures (interictal). * SEEG (Stereoelectroencephalography) - This is an advanced technique in which electrodes are surgically implanted into oneâ€™s brain. It is capable of detecting seizure activity deep in your brain, even in areas that are missed on an EEG. * Video EEG - In this test, an individualâ€™s behavior and movements are monitored alongside the electrical activity in the brain. Since NFLE mostly occurs at night, this test may require an overnight hospital stay when video EEG monitoring is done throughout oneâ€™s sleep. When family history is positive, gene testing may be advised in cases of ADNFLE. ## What Are the Possible Complications? Complications can include: * Physical injuries during the episode. Oneâ€™s cheek or tongue may be injured

require an overnight hospital stay when video EEG monitoring is done throughout oneâ€™s sleep. When family history is positive, gene testing may be advised in cases of ADNFLE. ## What Are the Possible Complications? Complications can include: * Physical injuries during the episode. Oneâ€™s cheek or tongue may be injured due to the jerking movements. Bruises or cuts and even fractures may result from episodes depending upon oneâ€™s surroundings and objects around. * Status epilepticus is a serious life-threatening emergency that may occur sometimes. It is characterized by seizures that last longer than five minutes or prolonged loss of consciousness between seizures. Immediate medical attention is necessary. * Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy can occur. The cause of death is not understood. It is rare and occurs in about one in a thousand individuals with seizures. ## What Is the Treatment for NFLE? Treatment approaches for NFLE include: 1. **Medications****-** Pharmacological management is the first choice in treating NFLE. The drug carbamazepine is commonly prescribed; a combination of antiepileptic drugs may also be used. Drugs modulate the brainâ€™s electrical activity and help decrease the frequency of episodes. However, carbamazepine is ineffective in about 30 % of NFLE cases. Alternate treatment strategies need to be adopted in such cases. 2. **Surgical Management****-** Cases unresponsive to medication are treated surgically. Preparation for surgery includes analyzing the brain to identify problematic areas and areas of important function. * A technique called brain mapping uses electrodes implanted in the brain; with electrical stimulation in

strategies need to be adopted in such cases. 2. **Surgical Management****-** Cases unresponsive to medication are treated surgically. Preparation for surgery includes analyzing the brain to identify problematic areas and areas of important function. * A technique called brain mapping uses electrodes implanted in the brain; with electrical stimulation in a particular area, it is determined if the area has an important function. Surgery is avoided in areas having important functions. * Functional MRI is done to map the language area of the brain. * Advanced imaging like SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) may also be used to pinpoint areas in which seizures originate. Depending on the area of seizure activity, the following may be achieved through surgery: 1. **Removal of the Focal Point****-** When seizures consistently begin from the same spot, removing a small amount of brain tissue can stop the seizure activity. 2. **Isolation of the Focal Spot****-** If the point of origin is important functionally and has to be conserved, it is separated from the rest of the brain through small cuts to prevent the spreading of seizures into other brain areas 3. **Vagus Nerve Stimulation****-** An implanted device analogous to a cardiac pacemaker stimulates the vagus nerve and decreases episodes. 4. **Responsive Neurotransmitters** may be implanted in the brain. This device is activated when a seizure begins and stops it. 5. **Deep Brain Stimulation** is another method involving electrical stimulation of the brain by means of implanted electrodes. Post-surgery anti-seizure drugs are prescribed. In addition,

This device is activated when a seizure begins and stops it. 5. **Deep Brain Stimulation** is another method involving electrical stimulation of the brain by means of implanted electrodes. Post-surgery anti-seizure drugs are prescribed. In addition, a ketogenic diet (high fat and low carbohydrate) is advised in epileptic individuals; it is associated with fewer seizures and is more effective in children. **Conclusion** Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy is a form of seizure disorder mostly occurring at night during sleep. The seizures originate from the frontal lobes located behind the forehead. It can be successfully managed with medication. Surgery is advised when medication is not effective. </content> </article> <article> <slug>midazolam-epilepsy-nasal-spray</slug> <content>**Drug Overview:** Midazolam nasal spray has been FDA-approved since 1985 for addressing emergencies by halting cluster seizures in adults and children aged 12 and above who are concurrently undergoing epilepsy treatment with other medications.

patient's typical seizure pattern, and it is intended for use in individuals aged 12 years and older with epilepsy. **Dose:** The recommended dose is five mg. Dosing Considerations: * Administer Midazolam via the nasal route exclusively. * **Initial Dose:** Administer one spray (five mg dose) into one nostril. * **Second Dose (if needed):** Administer an extra spray (five milligrams) in the alternate nostril if there is no response to the initial dose after 10 minutes. * Avoid a second Midazolam dose if the patient experiences difficulty breathing or excessive sedation during a seizure cluster episode. * **Maximum Dosage and Treatment Frequency:** Do not exceed two doses of Midazolam for a single episode. Limit Midazolam to one episode every three days and no more than five monthly episodes. ## What Are the Pharmacological Aspects of Midazolam? Mechanism of Action: Midazolam is a benzodiazepine that acts on the central nervous system. Its mechanism of action involves enhancing the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. * **GABA Receptor Modulation:** Midazolam binds to specific sites on the GABA-A (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) receptors located in the brain. GABA-A receptors are ionotropic receptors that, when activated, allow the influx of chloride ions, leading to membrane hyperpolarization. * **Increased GABAergic Activity:** Midazolam boosts the inhibitory effect of GABA by elevating the frequency of chloride channel opening when GABA binds. This results in an increased influx of chloride ions into the neurons. * **Neuronal Hyperpolarization:** The increased chloride influx

Chunk 307:
the influx of chloride ions, leading to membrane hyperpolarization. * **Increased GABAergic Activity:** Midazolam boosts the inhibitory effect of GABA by elevating the frequency of chloride channel opening when GABA binds. This results in an increased influx of chloride ions into the neurons. * **Neuronal Hyperpolarization:** The increased chloride influx hyperpolarizes the neuronal cell membrane, making it more resistant to depolarization and less likely to generate an action potential. This hyperpolarization inhibits excessive electrical activity in the brain, characteristic of seizures. * **CNS Depression:** Overall, the enhanced GABAergic activity induced by midazolam leads to central nervous system depression. This depressant effect helps reduce abnormal neuronal firing, providing a calming and anticonvulsant effect, particularly in seizure activity. **Pharmacodynamics:** **Receptor Interaction:** * Midazolam primarily interacts with GABA-A receptors in the central nervous system. * Binding to specific sites on these receptors modulates the response to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter. **GABAergic Activity Enhancement:** * Midazolam enhances the inhibitory action of GABA by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening in response to GABA binding. * This augmentation results in an increased influx of chloride ions, leading to membrane hyperpolarization. **Neuronal Hyperpolarization:** * The heightened influx of chloride ions hyperpolarizes the neuronal cell membrane, reducing excitability. * This effect makes neurons less likely to generate action potentials, contributing to an overall reduction in neuronal activity. * Central Nervous System Depression: * The cumulative impact of Midazolam's actions is central nervous system depression. * This depression manifests as sedation, anxiolysis, muscle relaxation,

Tolerability was assessed in the Test Dose Phase, supporting its potential as an effective option for acute seizure management in epilepsy patients aged 12 and older. ## What Are the Contraindications of Midazolam? **Allergic Reaction:** * Individuals who have experienced an allergic reaction to midazolam should avoid its use. * Symptoms of allergic reactions may include manifestations such as a rash, itching, swelling, profound dizziness, or challenges in breathing. * It is crucial for individuals with a known allergy to Midazolam or its components to inform their healthcare provider to prevent adverse reactions. **Acute Narrow-Angle Glaucoma:** * Midazolam is contraindicated in individuals with acute narrow-angle glaucoma. * In cases of narrow-angle glaucoma, heightened intraocular pressure is a defining condition. Midazolam's utilization in such situations can potentially exacerbate this pressure, possibly resulting in complications. * Patients with a history of narrow-angle glaucoma should inform their healthcare provider to ensure appropriate alternative medications are considered, and potential risks are minimized. **Warnings and Precautions:** Risks from Concomitant Use of Opioids: * Combining Midazolam and opioids may lead to severe sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and even death. * Concomitant prescribing should be limited to cases where alternative treatments are insufficient. * Observational studies show an increased risk of drug-related mortality with opioid and benzodiazepine use compared to opioids alone.

early as one week into treatment; risk persists for the duration of treatment. **Impaired Cognitive Function:** * Midazolam is associated with recall impairment for several hours after administration. * Caution against operating machinery or vehicles until drug effects subside. * Pediatric patients should be particularly cautious regarding safe ambulation. **Glaucoma:** * Benzodiazepines, including Midazolam, can increase intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. * Administer only to individuals with open-angle glaucoma if they are currently undergoing the correct treatment. * Contradicted in narrow-angle glaucoma patients. **Other Adverse Reactions:** * When used for sedation, midazolam may cause reactions such as agitation, involuntary movements, hyperactivity, and combativeness. * It is important to contemplate the potential for insufficient, excessive, or incorrect administration of Midazolam. **Specific Considerations** **Pregnancy:** Encouraging pregnant women prescribed Midazolam to participate in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) pregnancy registry is advised. However, there is a notable absence of well-controlled studies on midazolam in pregnant women. While current evidence on benzodiazepines as a class suggests no significant increase in congenital anomalies, clinical considerations underscore potential risks during midazolam exposure in the second and third trimesters. These risks include issues such as decreased fetal movement and "floppy infant syndrome," as well as the possibility of dependence and withdrawal. Consequently, the decision to use Midazolam during pregnancy should be carefully weighed, with the understanding that benefits to the mother must substantially outweigh potential risks to the fetus. **Lactation:** Midazolam is excreted in human milk, and this raises concerns about potential effects on breastfed infants,

possibility of dependence and withdrawal. Consequently, the decision to use Midazolam during pregnancy should be carefully weighed, with the understanding that benefits to the mother must substantially outweigh potential risks to the fetus. **Lactation:** Midazolam is excreted in human milk, and this raises concerns about potential effects on breastfed infants, including lethargy, somnolence, and poor sucking. When deciding to breastfeed while using Midazolam, it is essential to weigh the developmental and health advantages of breastfeeding against the clinical requirements of Midazolam for the mother. **Pediatric Use:** The safety and effectiveness of Midazolam have been evaluated in individuals aged 12 to 17 based on an adequate and well- controlled study. However, data for pediatric patients below 12 is limited, and safety and effectiveness in this age group have yet to be conclusively established. **Geriatric Use:** Studies assessing the safety and efficacy of Midazolam needed to include a sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over. Geriatric patients may experience prolonged drug exposure due to longer elimination half-lives and altered drug distribution. Hence, close monitoring is strongly recommended, particularly for individuals aged 70 and above. **Renal Impairment:** A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that individuals with mild renal impairment may exhibit similar pharmacokinetics to those with normal renal function. However, there is a lack of safety and efficacy data for individuals with severe renal impairment, and those with moderate impairment may experience slower elimination, resulting in prolonged drug exposure. **Congestive Heart Failure:** Individuals suffering from congestive heart failure experience a slower elimination of

However, there is a lack of safety and efficacy data for individuals with severe renal impairment, and those with moderate impairment may experience slower elimination, resulting in prolonged drug exposure. **Congestive Heart Failure:** Individuals suffering from congestive heart failure experience a slower elimination of Midazolam, resulting in an extended duration of drug exposure. This emphasizes the significance of meticulous evaluation and observation when administering Midazolam to individuals experiencing congestive heart failure. </content> </article> <article> <slug>epilepsy-treatment</slug> <content>**Introduction** Millions of people worldwide are affected by the neurological condition known as epilepsy, which is frequently characterized by recurring seizures. While anti-seizure drugs have traditionally been used to treat symptoms, recent developments have raised hopes for better seizure management and improved quality of life. This article discusses the innovative advancements that are redefining the way epilepsy treatment is done, giving patients new opportunities for seizure control and enhanced quality of life. These developments range from targeted drugs to surgical procedures and alternative techniques. ## What Are the New Advancements in Epilepsy Treatment? The new advancements in epilepsy treatment are discussed below. * **Wearable Seizure Detectors:** These tools can monitor seizure activity and aid in avoiding sudden fatalities brought on by uncontrolled seizures. * **Non-invasive Methods for Finding the Source of a Seizure:** Methods like stereo-electroencephalography can pinpoint the precise area of the brain that initiates a seizure, facilitating precise diagnosis and treatment. * **Responsive Neurostimulation:** This method includes implanting a device similar to a pacemaker in the brain

like vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TNS) can assist in identifying the most efficient modality. Additionally, gathering information on prospective non-invasive neurostimulation techniques will reveal details about their long-term safety and therapeutic efficacy. * **Modulation of Inflammatory Pathways:** Drugs that target particular inflammatory pathways may be able to reduce seizures and alleviate related comorbidities, including depression and cognitive deficiencies. Neuroinflammation has been linked to epilepsy. It is possible to use currently available anti-inflammatory medications to treat epilepsy. * **Multidrug Efflux Transporters** : Drug-resistant epilepsies may be characterized by the overexpression of multidrug efflux transporters such as P-gps. Modulating the expression of P-gps may be a promising strategy to combat drug resistance, even though using P-gp inhibitors has drawbacks due to systemic toxicity. * **Precision Approach and Personalized Medicine:** Epilepsy therapy is developing toward a precision strategy that incorporates clinical assessments with genomes and other -omics modalities, or "-omics" for short. The most effective treatments can be determined by understanding genetic variants and their functional impacts through investigations like patch-clamp experiments. Additionally, pharmacogenomics can help anticipate treatment responses and prevent side effects. * **Innovative Medicines and Gene Therapy:** New epilepsy treatments may one day be available thanks to developments in gene-based medicines. However, issues like the complexity of DNA connections and the invasiveness of neurosurgical techniques must be resolved. Targeted treatments like gene therapy are now expensive, but as medication development becomes more standardized and widespread, their price may decrease. * **Inflammatory Pathways as

be available thanks to developments in gene-based medicines. However, issues like the complexity of DNA connections and the invasiveness of neurosurgical techniques must be resolved. Targeted treatments like gene therapy are now expensive, but as medication development becomes more standardized and widespread, their price may decrease. * **Inflammatory Pathways as Treatment Targets** : Since inflammatory pathways are present in many different kinds of epilepsy, they might make good therapy targets. Targeting intricate and interrelated circuits, however, may be difficult and may have unfavorable implications on patients' quality of life. * **Phenotyping and Early Diagnosis** : In treating epilepsy, it is critical to enhance phenotyping and achieve early diagnosis. Standardized phenotyping techniques, like the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), can aid in the early detection and non-invasive treatment of phenotypic anomalies. ## What Is the New Treatment for Epilepsy in 2023? In 2023, sodium selenate, a medication that may be curative, and laser beam therapy will be among the latest epilepsy treatments. The first possible curative treatment for epilepsy patients who are resistant to the current anti-seizure medications has been identified as sodium selenite. It is regarded as an epilepsy treatment that modifies the condition. Sodium selenate has been demonstrated in animal experiments to lessen seizure frequency and, in some circumstances, to stop seizures altogether. Additionally, it enhances the functioning of the sensorimotor system, learning, and memory in epileptics. With the aid of a $3 million grant, sodium selenate clinical trials as a curative therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy are about to get

experiments to lessen seizure frequency and, in some circumstances, to stop seizures altogether. Additionally, it enhances the functioning of the sensorimotor system, learning, and memory in epileptics. With the aid of a $3 million grant, sodium selenate clinical trials as a curative therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy are about to get underway. The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK now provides a brand-new type of laser therapy for epilepsy. This treatment avoids invasive surgery by employing a fiber optic laser beam to target and eliminate the brain tissue that causes epilepsy. In order to properly observe and navigate to the desired area while avoiding important structures, the operation is carried out during continuous, real-time MRI scanning. Because laser therapy is less invasive than conventional neurosurgery, patients recover more quickly after treatment and spend less time in the hospital. For people with uncontrolled focal seizures for whom traditional surgery offers hazards, it is especially helpful. Up to 150 individuals a year are projected to benefit from the first laser beam procedures, which are anticipated to be done in 2023. For people with epilepsy who have not responded to conventional drugs or are not good surgical candidates, these innovative treatments offer hope. They provide possible curative or disease-modifying approaches to treating epilepsy, addressing the drawbacks of existing treatments and enhancing patients' quality of life. ## What Does the Recent Research Say About Epilepsy Treatment? * **New Classification of Epilepsies:** To complement the current electroclinical classification of epilepsies, a new classification system has

This classification aids in determining when a single seizure characterized by abnormal EEG or imaging can be classified as epilepsy. * **Status Epilepticus** : Midazolam IM (intramuscular) has become the benzodiazepine of choice for treating status epilepticus outside of the hospital. Although more clinical research is required, it is also seen as an acceptable option in hospital settings. * **Limbic Encephalitis Immunotherapy:** As more cases of limbic encephalitis are being identified, immunotherapy has replaced antiepileptic medications (AEDs) as the first line of treatment. Antibodies' role in epilepsy is still not completely understood. * **Efficacy of AEDs:** The most effective AEDs for absence epilepsy have been found to be ethosuximide and valproate, despite the fact that most epileptic therapies lack a strong evidence base. New medications for treating tonic-clonic seizures in people with generalized epilepsy include perampanel and lacosamide. * **Genetic Epilepsies:** Specific genetic epilepsies have made individualized treatment possible in some circumstances. However, its wider applicability is still in its infancy. Research on epileptogenesis, the mechanism through which epilepsy develops, is a burgeoning field. Everolimus, an inhibitor of the mTOR system, has demonstrated effectiveness in treating tuberous sclerosis-related epilepsy, highlighting the

Specific genetic epilepsies have made individualized treatment possible in some circumstances. However, its wider applicability is still in its infancy. Research on epileptogenesis, the mechanism through which epilepsy develops, is a burgeoning field. Everolimus, an inhibitor of the mTOR system, has demonstrated effectiveness in treating tuberous sclerosis-related epilepsy, highlighting the promise of this line of inquiry. * **Use of Antiepileptic Medications During Pregnancy:** It has been well documented in epilepsy and pregnancy registers. Major congenital abnormalities have been linked to the lowest risk by Lamotrigine, Levetiracetam, Carbamazepine, and Oxcarbazepine. * **Comorbid Depression Treatment** : Because most current antidepressants have few side effects on epilepsy, they can be used to treat comorbid depression in epilepsy patients. * **Surgery:** The use of surgery for treating epilepsy is currently insufficient. With the addition of functional imaging to structural imaging, the process of choosing patients for surgical intervention is becoming more precise. Investigating alternative Ablative therapies and stimulation methods, research is still being done on non-Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) stimulation methods and alternative ablative therapies for treating epilepsy. **Conclusion** In conclusion, the advances in epilepsy treatment have broadened patients options. These include novel medications and emerging technologies like laser therapy. These advancements have definitely contributed to the improvement of epilepsy patients' quality of life. Ongoing research will continue to explore and identify novel therapy possibilities, improving the management of this ailment. </content> </article> <article> <slug>benign-rolandic-epilepsy</slug> <content>## What Is a Benign Rolandic Epilepsy?

Benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE), also called benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) or benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes (BECCTS), accounts for the most common epilepsy syndrome in children. This condition usually outgrows the affected children by the time they reach puberty. It is given the term â€œrolandicâ€ because the seizures originate in the rolandic (also called centrotemporal) area of the brain. This part of the brain controls the face, mouth, and throat. A seizure is a disorder with sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain. This can lead to symptoms such as confusion, muscle jerking, and loss of consciousness. ## What Causes Benign Rolandic Epilepsy? The exact cause of benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE) is unknown. But it has been classified as a genetic disorder because approximately 25 percent of the patients having this condition have a family history of either epilepsy or febrile seizures (fits that happen when a child has a fever). Although there has not been any identification of a specific gene, chromosome 11 and chromosome 15 are thought to be involved in this condition. ## When Does Benign Rolandic Epilepsy Occur? Benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE) can occur between the ages of one to 14 years. However, the majority of the cases peak around seven to ten years

of a specific gene, chromosome 11 and chromosome 15 are thought to be involved in this condition. ## When Does Benign Rolandic Epilepsy Occur? Benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE) can occur between the ages of one to 14 years. However, the majority of the cases peak around seven to ten years of age. The predominance of benign rolandic epilepsy is seen in boys, as it occurs more frequently in boys than in girls. The incidence of this condition is 10 to 20 per 100,000 children aged less than 15 years, thereby making up for about 15 percent of all epilepsy cases in children. This leads to BRE being the most common epileptic syndrome in childhood. It does not affect adults. ## What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Benign Rolandic Epilepsy? Benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE) has the greatest incidence (70 percent) of occurrence at night or after waking up. Seizures originate from the rolandic area of the brain, which controls the face, mouth, and throat. They are infrequent, partial (focal), and with no loss of consciousness. Symptoms are generally unilateral (affecting only one side of the face) and include: * Facial twitching and stiffness. * Numbness or tingling of the face and throat includes lips, tongue, gums, inner side of the cheek, and teeth. * Speaking difficulties with gurgling (hollow bubbling) noises. * Speech arrest (temporary inability to speak). * Drooling of saliva. * Hypersalivation (producing more saliva by the salivary gland than usual). Seizures usually last for two to three

and throat includes lips, tongue, gums, inner side of the cheek, and teeth. * Speaking difficulties with gurgling (hollow bubbling) noises. * Speech arrest (temporary inability to speak). * Drooling of saliva. * Hypersalivation (producing more saliva by the salivary gland than usual). Seizures usually last for two to three minutes. Facial twitching of the face can spread and affect the arms and legs on the same side. Occasionally, seizures can become generalized by spreading and involving both sides. This can have other manifestations, such as: * Generalized shaking. * Stiffening of the body. * Loss of bowel and bladder control. * Loss of consciousness. * Postictal state (recovery period after a seizure). The occurrence of seizures mostly at night and being partial (affecting only one side) makes them go unnoticed until there is a full-blown generalized seizure. Status epilepticus (continuous seizures lasting for more than five minutes, without any period of recovery in between) and sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) are rare. Other associated symptoms include: * Headaches or migraines. * Behavioral and learning difficulties. These symptoms are more common when the child has seizures and abnormalities in the electroencephalogram (EEG). However, when the child reaches age 15, they outgrow the seizures, the symptoms improve, EEG normalizes, and no developmental problems are seen. ## How Is Benign Rolandic Epilepsy Diagnosed? Similar to other epileptic syndromes, the diagnosis of BRE by a healthcare provider can be established based on the symptoms, family history, and a characteristic electroencephalogram (EEG) finding.

Similar to other epileptic syndromes, the diagnosis of BRE by a healthcare provider can be established based on the symptoms, family history, and a characteristic electroencephalogram (EEG) finding. The centrotemporal spikes seen in the EEG are indicative of BRE. The healthcare provider may also order MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans to examine the brain of the child, but it is often unnecessary if the child has typical symptoms. ## How Is Benign Rolandic Epilepsy Treated? As suggested by the name, BRE is generally a benign condition. In addition, the child outgrows the seizures almost always by the time they reach adolescence. Therefore, BRE most often does not require any treatment. This is especially true because the seizures are mostly infrequent and partial and mainly occur at night if the child, parent, or family are agreeable. The treatment may be considered when the seizures become severe and frequent, occur during the daytime, are generalized, and are associated with speaking and learning disabilities. The treatment decision should lie with the patient and their family whether or not to treat the condition in consultation with their healthcare provider. The doctor may recommend a single antiepileptic drug (AED) if the treatment is considered necessary. It is sufficient, and rarely are multiple AEDs required. The dosage is suggested for nighttime. Because of the partial or focal nature of the seizures, the drug Carbamazepine

condition in consultation with their healthcare provider. The doctor may recommend a single antiepileptic drug (AED) if the treatment is considered necessary. It is sufficient, and rarely are multiple AEDs required. The dosage is suggested for nighttime. Because of the partial or focal nature of the seizures, the drug Carbamazepine is usually the first-line agent. A few other drugs that have been used include: * Oxcarbazepine. * Gabapentin. * Levetiracetam. * Valproate. * Phenytoin. * Lacosamide. * Zonisamide. The treatment of BRE is usually of short duration and can be discontinued after the child becomes free of seizures for about one to two years. The dosage of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can be tapered and eventually stopped based on the electroencephalogram (EEG) findings (normal versus abnormal). However, there is a possibility of recurrence of seizures after the discontinuation of AEDs. The patient and their family should be aware of this possibility of recurrence and must be vigilant. ## How to Help a Child During a Seizure? If the child is having seizures, one must keep in mind the following points- * Gently try to get them in a safe position. * Keep all the sharp objects away. * Do not try to restrict their movements. * Do not put anything in their mouth. * Lay them on their side because drooling occurs. **Conclusion:** Benign rolandic epilepsy, or BRE, is the most common epilepsy seen during childhood.

It is an unexpected episode of electrical disturbance in the brain that can cause uncontrollable reactions in the body, such as loss of consciousness, jerky movements, rigidity, unusual sensations, and altered behavior. Seizures are associated with several medical conditions involving the brain. Sometimes having a seizure attack may cause more damage to brain function. There are several identified types of seizures, depending on the symptoms, intensity, and clinical manifestations. Some seizures are mild with minimal symptoms, whereas some other types involve whole-body fits. Understanding the underlying cause and expert management can bring seizure attacks under control. ## What Is the Main Cause of Seizures? Under normal conditions, the nerve cells in the brain send out chemical substances and electrical impulses to the rest of the body to control and regulate its activities. When there is a functional impairment in any area of the brain, the electrical activity might lose its rhythm and tend to malfunction. In some

Chunk 327:
the nerve cells in the brain send out chemical substances and electrical impulses to the rest of the body to control and regulate its activities. When there is a functional impairment in any area of the brain, the electrical activity might lose its rhythm and tend to malfunction. In some situations, many nerve cells send electrical impulses at once without warning, which causes a burst of electrical activity throughout the body. This is presented as a seizure attack. The abnormal electrical activity can be due to known or unknown reasons. When the seizure attacks keep coming back in a repeated pattern due to an imbalance in the brain's electrical rhythm, the condition is called epilepsy. Leaving seizures untreated might lead to increased recurrence and worsening of symptoms. Each episode tends to get prolonged and damage the brain, ending up in a state of coma or death. Seizures form as a result of the following conditions as well: * Illnesses like stroke, infections in the brain, head injury, and brain tumors. * When there are structural abnormalities and damaged areas inside the brain. * Intense stress. * Extremely low blood sugar levels may be due to poor food intake. * Electrolytic imbalances in the body. * Excessive use of alcohol and abusive drugs. Withdrawal from these can also develop seizures. * Long periods of sleep deprivation. * Flashing lights. * Prolonged high fevers. * Certain neurological conditions involve mental disabilities acquired by birth. ## What Are the Different Types of Seizures?

imbalances in the body. * Excessive use of alcohol and abusive drugs. Withdrawal from these can also develop seizures. * Long periods of sleep deprivation. * Flashing lights. * Prolonged high fevers. * Certain neurological conditions involve mental disabilities acquired by birth. ## What Are the Different Types of Seizures? Depending on the area of the brain involved in the abnormal electrical activity, Seizures can be: 1. **Generalized Seizure** \- When both sides of the brain are involved, including myoclonic seizures, tonic-clonic seizures or grand mal seizures, atonic seizures, tonic seizures, and absence seizures. 2. **Focal Seizures** \- When a single area in one side of the brain is involved, including simple focal seizures, complex focal seizures, and secondarily generalized seizures. ## What Is an Aura Associated With a Seizure? For some individuals, the seizure attack follows a phase called an aura. It is a group of symptoms one experiences before the attack, including: * Feeling dizzy. * The blurring of vision and headache. * Unknown fears, anxiety, and deja vu. * Strange ringing noises in the ears. * Nausea, along with a bitter taste in the mouth. * Out-of-body feeling. * Numbness and tingling in the body. * Tremors in arms and legs, one might drop the things they are holding. ## What Are the Symptoms of Seizures?

in arms and legs, one might drop the things they are holding. ## What Are the Symptoms of Seizures? The degree of symptoms depends on the type of seizure attack. It can be as minimal as a moment of stillness, blinking of the eyes, or a confused look on the face. Or it can happen with violent shaking of the entire body, falling onto the ground, and losing consciousness. An actual seizure attack may have all or some of the following problems going on: 1. Went unconscious for a while, staying confused afterward. 2. Involuntary jerking of the body, uncontrollable muscle spasms, and stiffness. A violent fit can cause fractures and bruises in the body too. 3. Rapid, uncontrollable eye movements. 4. Frothing saliva drooling from the mouth. 5. A strange taste in the mouth. 6. Clenching teeth might accidentally bite into the tongue, harming it. 7. One might cry out loud or make strange grunting noises. 8. Lose bowel and bladder control. 9. Mood alterations. 10. After the seizure attack, one might feel drowsy, tired, confused, and anxious for several hours or the coming few days. ## How to Diagnose a Seizure Attack? Seizures are diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and physical examination of the patient. Based on the presentation of symptoms at the time of the attack, the doctor can know which area of the brain is possibly affected. To understand more about abnormal brain function, one can also perform a neurological assessment. To confirm the diagnosis, one

symptoms and physical examination of the patient. Based on the presentation of symptoms at the time of the attack, the doctor can know which area of the brain is possibly affected. To understand more about abnormal brain function, one can also perform a neurological assessment. To confirm the diagnosis, one orders additional tests like an electroencephalogram (EEG), where electrodes are attached to the head to note down the pattern of electrical activity in the brain. Additionally, one can perform computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to understand the underlying cause of seizure attacks. ## What to Do When Someone Is Having a Seizure? The family members and caretakers must be aware of what to do immediately at the time of a seizure attack when you see one. Following are the steps to follow: 1. Make the affected lie down on the floor on one side to avoid choking on saliva and help with easy breathing. 2. Make sure the area is clear of sharp and hard objects that might hurt the affected while having a fit. 3. Place something soft under the head as a cushioning so that the head does not hit the floor. 4. Remove eyeglasses, tight clothing, or accessories that can harm or suffocate the individual. 5. If the seizure does not stop even after five minutes from the start, get emergency medical help. ## What Is the Treatment for Seizures?

eyeglasses, tight clothing, or accessories that can harm or suffocate the individual. 5. If the seizure does not stop even after five minutes from the start, get emergency medical help. ## What Is the Treatment for Seizures? People who suffer a single seizure episode may not even require further treatment if the tests do not show any abnormal findings. Those who suffer multiple seizure attacks can be labeled epileptic and require treatment. Treatment involves: * Antiepileptic drugs for controlling the tendency of the brain cells to burst out electrical signals. The majority of the patients get good results with the drugs. Commonly prescribed antiepileptic drugs are Sodium valproate, Carbamazepine, Lamotrigine, Levetiracetam, and Topiramate. * Diet alterations - Eating a balanced diet and taking plenty of fluids helps. Doctors suggest special diets like the keto diet and Atkins diet as well. One can also maintain adequate sleep and do regular exercise to reduce the risk of seizures. Avoiding stress and substance abuse is recommended as well. * Surgical corrections are performed to remove the underlying cause of seizure attacks, such as tumors or a part of the brain that is malfunctioning. * Procedures like vagus nerve stimulation help reduce the frequency of seizure attacks, where a stimulator device is implanted under the skin to send electrical impulses. **Conclusion:** A seizure attack can temporarily alter a personâ€™s behavior, time-place-person awareness, movement, and feelings, which can be pretty upsetting for the affected and the onlookers.

Some types of seizures can be life-threatening if they persist for more than 30 minutes and cause permanent injury to the brain or even death. The perplexing factor about a seizure attack is its unpredictability in occurrence. It is a relief that seizures can be brought under control to a great extent by suitable medications. Seeking the help of a qualified medical professional to identify the underlying problem is the first step toward a cure. </content> </article> <article> <slug>topiramate</slug> <content>**Overview** Topiramate is an anticonvulsant drug used to control epilepsy. The anti- epileptic is also used in the prevention and treatment of migraine. Topiramate is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medicine for preventing adult migraines. The extended-release Topiramate formulation and Phentermine are approved for chronic weight management in adults. ## How Does Topiramate Work? Topiramate works inside the brain by interfering with the brain signals used to communicate with the rest of the body. It works by helping in preventing nerve cells from sending signals and reduces bursts of electrical activity in the brain. Topiramate also blocks the voltage-dependent sodium channels resulting in reduced seizure activity. **Uses of Topiramate:** * Topiramate is used alone or with other medicines to treat certain kinds of seizures, such as primary generalized

A supplemental dose may be required in patients undergoing hemodialysis. * **Nephrolithiasis -** Therapy with Topiramate has been reported to be associated with the development of kidney stones. The drug should be administered cautiously in patients with a history of nephrolithiasis. **For Patients** ## What Is Epilepsy? Epilepsy is characterized by seizures, which are unusual electrical discharges caused in the brain that may temporarily disrupt the brain's normal function. Seizures are classified as generalized, originating in both sides of the brain simultaneously or partially, starting in one area of the brain. * **Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizure -** Formerly known as grand mal seizure, is a seizure that has a tonic phase followed by clonic muscle contractions. It is associated with impaired awareness or complete loss of consciousness. A generalized tonic-clonic seizure can be termed a motor seizure that arises rapidly and causes violent muscle contractions. People usually do not remember the seizure afterward. * **Partial Onset Seizure -** It is also known as focal onset seizure that begins in one half of the brain. Partial onset seizure is the most frequent seizure experienced by people with epilepsy. During a partial-onset seizure, the patient

muscle contractions. People usually do not remember the seizure afterward. * **Partial Onset Seizure -** It is also known as focal onset seizure that begins in one half of the brain. Partial onset seizure is the most frequent seizure experienced by people with epilepsy. During a partial-onset seizure, the patient is aware of what has happened or may lose consciousness. **Symptoms of Seizure:** * Temporary confusion. * Uncontrollable jerky movements. * Fear or anxiety. * Stiffening of the body. * Loss of bowel or bladder control. * Loss of consciousness. ## Why Is Topiramate Prescribed for Epilepsy? Anti-epileptic drugs, such as Topiramate, are selected based on the type of seizure. The brain cells are forced to work faster and more rapidly during a seizure. Topiramate helps prevent brain cells from working as fast as a seizure requires and restores the normal balance of nerve activity. ## What Is Migraine Headache? It is a neurological disorder associated with significant disability and impaired quality of life, affecting many people's daily activities and work- related productivity. It is caused by abnormal brain activity that temporarily affects nerve signals, chemicals, and blood vessels in the brain. It is characterized by severe throbbing pain on one side of the head. The other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. These patients require bed rest in addition to medication, such as Topiramate. ## Why Is Topiramate Prescribed For Migraine Headache?

Sprinkle capsules consist of Topiramate-coated beads in a hard gelatin capsule. The inactive ingredients are black pharmaceutical ink, cellulose acetate, gelatin, povidone, sodium lauryl sulfate, sorbitan monolaurate, sugar spheres, and titanium dioxide. **Clinical Pharmacology:** 1. **Mechanism of Action -** Topiramate stimulates GABA-A (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor activity at brain non-benzodiazepine receptor sites and reduces glutamate activity at both AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) and kainate receptors. By increasing GABA activity and inhibiting glutamate activity, Topiramate blocks neuronal excitability and prevents seizures. Topiramate also blocks the voltage-dependent sodium channels and blocks seizure activity. **2\. Pharmacodynamics** Topiramte has anticonvulsant activity. Changes from the baseline in vital signs, such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, occur more frequently in pediatric patients. The changes are dose-related. **3**.**Pharmacokinetics** * The mean Cmax- 1.73 to 28.7 ug/ml. * Median Tmax- 1.8 to 4.3 hours.

etiology. Seizures, intermittent episodes caused by abnormally synchronized neuronal activity in the brain, can take many forms and have varied effects on different people. ## What Is Seizure Semiology? The study and evaluation of seizure features and clinical manifestations are known as seizure semiology. It entails watching for and noting the symptoms that people experience during seizure episodes. Healthcare workers can learn important information about seizures' type, cause, and characteristics by closely studying and analyzing seizure semiology, which can help diagnose, categorize, and manage epilepsy. The broad variety of characteristics that make up seizure semiology can change based on the kind of seizure and where it occurs in the brain. These characteristics may include changes in consciousness, emotional states, and cognitive abilities, as well as motor symptoms like muscle twitching, jerking, or stiffness; sensory symptoms like tingling, numbness, or hallucinations; autonomic symptoms like changes in heart rate or perspiration; and sensory symptoms like tingling, numbness, or hallucinations. Seizure semiology analysis considers all the stages of a seizure, including the prodromal phase (early symptoms that precede a seizure), the seizure onset, the ictal phase, and the postictal phase (the period after the seizure). Each stage offers crucial knowledge for comprehending the type of seizure and its underlying mechanics. ## What Are the Principles of Seizure Semiology? Seizure semiology's main tenets are as follows: 1. **Detailed Observation:** It is necessary for seizure semiology to identify the signs and symptoms people experience during seizures properly.

type of seizure and its underlying mechanics. ## What Are the Principles of Seizure Semiology? Seizure semiology's main tenets are as follows: 1. **Detailed Observation:** It is necessary for seizure semiology to identify the signs and symptoms people experience during seizures properly. It entails keeping track of the order, length, and course of symptoms and any concomitant shifts in consciousness or behavior. 2. **Classification** : The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification and other established classification schemes and seizure semiology are essential in classifying seizures into various categories. It facilitates distinguishing between focal, generalized, and other particular seizure types, enabling tailored therapeutic strategies. 3. **Localization:** Seizure semiology helps pinpoint where a seizure is coming from in the brain. Healthcare practitioners can pinpoint the brain network or region engaged in a seizure by studying the precise signs and symptoms experienced throughout the episode. This helps pinpoint the seizure's focus. 4. **Semiologic Seizure Types:** According to seizure semiology, there are various semiologic seizure types, each of which is distinguished by a particular set of signs and symptoms. These include focal seizures of the motor system, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, focal seizures of the sensory system, focal seizures of the autonomic system, and focal seizures of the cognitive system, such as focal seizures of impaired awareness. Accurate seizure classification and treatment choices are made easier by understanding various semiologic seizure categories. 5. **Communication and Documentation:** It's crucial to communicate clearly and to document seizure semiology thoroughly.

seizures of the cognitive system, such as focal seizures of impaired awareness. Accurate seizure classification and treatment choices are made easier by understanding various semiologic seizure categories. 5. **Communication and Documentation:** It's crucial to communicate clearly and to document seizure semiology thoroughly. The observable indications, symptoms, and their temporal order are described clearly and precisely to aid in accurate diagnosis, allow interdisciplinary cooperation, and enhance care continuity. ## What Are the Advantages of Seizure Semiology? The following are some major benefits of seizure semiology: 1. **Accurate Diagnosis:** Seizure semiology is essential for making a precise epilepsy diagnosis. Healthcare providers can distinguish between various seizure types and non-epileptic occurrences by carefully studying and documenting the individual signs and symptoms displayed during seizures. This allows for a more accurate diagnosis and effective treatment planning. 2. **Seizure Classification:** Recognized systems, such as the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification, can classify seizures when seizure semiology is understood. The classification of seizures aids in developing effective treatment plans, prognosis evaluations, and interprofessional communication. 3. **Focus:** Seizure semiology helps pinpoint the exact location of a seizure's onset within the brain. Medical doctors can pinpoint the area of the brain or organ causing seizures by examining the precise signs and symptoms seen during seizures. 4. **Treatment Choice:** For people with epilepsy, seizure semiology helps make the right treatment decisions. Various antiepileptic drugs or other therapeutic measures may affect various seizure types. Seizure semiology can help clinicians accurately identify and categorize seizures so that treatment approaches can

the precise signs and symptoms seen during seizures. 4. **Treatment Choice:** For people with epilepsy, seizure semiology helps make the right treatment decisions. Various antiepileptic drugs or other therapeutic measures may affect various seizure types. Seizure semiology can help clinicians accurately identify and categorize seizures so that treatment approaches can be customized to enhance effectiveness and reduce negative effects. 5. **Evaluation of the Epilepsy Prognosis:** Seizure Semiology offers important insights into epilepsy prognosis. Seizure types and their semiologic characteristics may be linked to favorable or unfavorable outcomes. Healthcare providers can advise patients and their families about the anticipated course of the illness and prospective treatment outcomes by analyzing seizure semiology. ## What Are the Disadvantages of Seizure Semiology? Although seizure semiology has several benefits, there are some potential drawbacks to take into account as well: 1. **Subjectivity:** Seizure semiology depends on the individual interpretation of clinical observations by healthcare practitioners. This subjectivity could result in variations in seizure localization and classification. 2. **Complexity:** Seizure semiology can be intricate and multifaceted, necessitating a thorough comprehension of various seizure forms and associated symptoms. Clinicians may encounter difficulties correctly interpreting and categorizing seizures due to this intricacy. 3. **Limited Specificity:** Some seizure semiologic symptoms might be nonspecific or overlap with other disorders, which could cause confusion in the diagnosis and lead to incorrect conclusions. 4. **Variability in Expression:** Even within the same seizure type, there can be significant individual variation in seizure semiology. This diversity makes it difficult to identify recurring trends and

symptoms might be nonspecific or overlap with other disorders, which could cause confusion in the diagnosis and lead to incorrect conclusions. 4. **Variability in Expression:** Even within the same seizure type, there can be significant individual variation in seizure semiology. This diversity makes it difficult to identify recurring trends and extrapolate results across several patients. 5. **Information That Is Not Complete:** Seizure semiology relies on information given by the person having seizures or by witnesses. This information might need to be completed, particularly if the person's awareness is compromised during the seizure or if bystanders have limited capacity for observation. **Conclusion** Seizure diagnosis and classification heavily depend on seizure semiology. It entails meticulously observing and outlining a person's numerous signs and symptoms throughout a seizure episode. Healthcare workers can learn vital details about the kind, source, and potential underlying causes of seizures by investigating seizure semiology. Motor, sensory, autonomic, and cognitive symptoms are a few manifestations that fall under the umbrella of seizure semiology. These symptoms might vary substantially depending on the type of seizure and the precise brain regions implicated. </content> </article> <article> <slug>maternal-seizure-disorder</slug> <content>**Introduction** Seizures occur when there is abnormal electrical activity in the brain, leading to a range of symptoms that can vary in severity and duration.

range of symptoms that can vary in severity and duration. When a woman with epilepsy becomes pregnant, the condition may have implications for both her and the developing fetus. The management of epilepsy during pregnancy requires a delicate balance between controlling seizures with medications while minimizing potential harm to the developing fetus. This article discusses the prevalence of maternal seizure disorder, its impact on pregnancy and childbirth, and strategies for managing epilepsy during pregnancy. We will also explore the potential risks and benefits of antiepileptic medications during pregnancy and the importance of individualized treatment plans based on the patient's unique medical history and circumstances. ## What Is the Impact of Maternal Seizure Disorder on Pregnancy and Childbirth? The condition may increase the risk of complications for both the mother and the developing fetus and can also pose challenges in managing seizures during pregnancy. Some potential impacts of maternal seizure disorder on pregnancy and childbirth include: * Increased risk of maternal complications such as preeclampsia, premature labor, and postpartum hemorrhage. * Increased risk of fetal complications such as fetal distress, preterm birth, and low birth weight. * Increased risk of birth defects in the developing fetus, particularly when the mother takes certain antiepileptic medications during pregnancy. * Challenges in managing seizures during pregnancy, as some medications may not be safe for the developing fetus, and other treatments may not be effective. * The potential need for specialized care during labor and delivery, such as continuous fetal monitoring and coordination with a

certain antiepileptic medications during pregnancy. * Challenges in managing seizures during pregnancy, as some medications may not be safe for the developing fetus, and other treatments may not be effective. * The potential need for specialized care during labor and delivery, such as continuous fetal monitoring and coordination with a neurologist. * Increased risk of cognitive and developmental delays in the child, particularly if the mother experiences frequent seizures during pregnancy or takes certain antiepileptic medications. It is important for women with a maternal seizure disorder to work closely with their healthcare providers to manage their condition during pregnancy and minimize the risks to themselves and their developing fetus. ## What Are Some Strategies for Managing Epilepsy During Pregnancy? Managing epilepsy during pregnancy can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help women with maternal seizure disorder minimize the risks to themselves and their developing fetuses. Some of these strategies include: 1. **Developing an Individualized Treatment Plan:** Every woman with a maternal seizure disorder is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to treatment. It is important to work with a healthcare provider to develop an individualized treatment plan that takes into account the patient's unique medical history, preferences, and values. 2. **Regularly Monitoring Seizure Activity:** Regular monitoring of seizure activity during pregnancy can help ensure that the treatment plan is effective and make any necessary adjustments. 3. **Taking Antiepileptic Medications:** Women with maternal seizure disorder may need to continue taking antiepileptic medications during pregnancy to reduce the

preferences, and values. 2. **Regularly Monitoring Seizure Activity:** Regular monitoring of seizure activity during pregnancy can help ensure that the treatment plan is effective and make any necessary adjustments. 3. **Taking Antiepileptic Medications:** Women with maternal seizure disorder may need to continue taking antiepileptic medications during pregnancy to reduce the risk of seizures. However, some medications may not be safe for the developing fetus, so it is important to work with a healthcare provider to choose the most appropriate medication. 4. **Avoiding Seizure Triggers:** Some women with maternal seizure disorder may have certain triggers that can increase the risk of seizures, such as lack of sleep or stress. Avoiding these triggers can help reduce the risk of seizures. 5. **Getting Adequate Prenatal Care:** Regular prenatal care is important for all pregnant women, but it is especially important for women with maternal seizure disorder. Healthcare providers can monitor the health of the mother and developing fetus, and make any necessary adjustments to the treatment plan. 6. **Being Prepared for Labor and Delivery:** Women with maternal seizure disorder may need specialized care during labor and delivery, such as continuous fetal monitoring and coordination with a neurologist. By working closely with the healthcare providers and following these strategies, women with maternal seizure disorder can have successful pregnancies and healthy babies. ## What Are the Potential Risks and Benefits of Antiepileptic Medications During Pregnancy?

providers and following these strategies, women with maternal seizure disorder can have successful pregnancies and healthy babies. ## What Are the Potential Risks and Benefits of Antiepileptic Medications During Pregnancy? Antiepileptic medications are commonly used to control seizures in pregnant women with epilepsy. However, these medications come with potential risks and benefits that must be carefully considered before use during pregnancy. **Potential Risks:** 1. **Birth Defects:** Certain antiepileptic medications, such as Valproic Acid and Phenobarbital, have been associated with an increased risk of birth defects when taken during pregnancy. 2. **Cognitive and Behavioral Issues:** Exposure to certain antiepileptic medications during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of cognitive and behavioral issues in children, including developmental delays, autism spectrum disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 3. **Miscarriage and Stillbirth:** Women taking antiepileptic medications during pregnancy may have an increased risk of miscarriage or stillbirth. 4. **Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome:** Infants born to women who took certain antiepileptic medications during pregnancy may experience withdrawal symptoms after birth, including irritability, jitteriness, and seizures. **Benefits:** 1. **Seizure Control:** Antiepileptic medications are used to control seizures in women with epilepsy. Uncontrolled seizures during pregnancy can be dangerous for both the mother and the developing fetus. 2. **Improved Maternal Health:** Antiepileptic medications can also improve the overall health of the mother by reducing the risk of injury during seizures and improving the quality of life. 3. **Prevention of Complications:** Antiepileptic medications can also prevent complications during pregnancy, such as preeclampsia, premature labor, and fetal

It is essential for pregnant women with epilepsy to work closely with the healthcare providers to weigh the potential risks and benefits of antiepileptic medication use during pregnancy and make informed decisions about their treatment. Women should never stop taking antiepileptic medications without first consulting with their healthcare providers. ## What Is the Importance of Individualized Treatment Plans Based on the Patientâ€™s Unique Medical History and Circumstances? The importance of individualized treatment plans based on the patient's unique medical history and circumstances in managing maternal seizure disorder during pregnancy includes the following: * Every patient's medical history and circumstances are unique, and there is no "one size fits all" treatment approach for managing maternal seizure disorder during pregnancy. * Factors such as the type and frequency of seizures, the patient's age and overall health, and the potential risks and benefits of different medications must all be taken into account when developing an individualized treatment plan. * An individualized treatment plan can help optimize seizure control while minimizing potential harm to the developing fetus, as the risks and benefits of different medications will vary from patient to patient. * It is important for healthcare providers to work closely with the

when developing an individualized treatment plan. * An individualized treatment plan can help optimize seizure control while minimizing potential harm to the developing fetus, as the risks and benefits of different medications will vary from patient to patient. * It is important for healthcare providers to work closely with the patients to develop an individualized treatment plan that takes into account the patient's unique medical history, preferences, and values. This can help ensure that the patient receives the best possible care and achieves the best possible outcomes for herself and her developing fetus. * Regular monitoring and adjustment of the treatment plan may be necessary throughout the course of the pregnancy to ensure that both the mother and the developing fetus are as healthy as possible. **Conclusion** Managing epilepsy during pregnancy requires an individualized approach that takes into account the unique medical history and circumstances of the patient. Strategies such as regular monitoring, taking antiepileptic medications, and avoiding triggers can help minimize the risks to both the mother and the developing fetus. With proper care and management, women with a maternal seizure disorder can have successful pregnancies and healthy babies. </content> </article> <article> <slug>juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy</slug> <content>**Introduction** The idiopathic, genetic, and generalized condition known as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), often referred to as Janz syndrome and impulsive petit mal, is a kind of epilepsy.

condition known as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), often referred to as Janz syndrome and impulsive petit mal, is a kind of epilepsy. Herpin first identified it in 1867; later, Janz and Christian defined it as an "impulsive petit mal" in 1957; and Lund identified it as JME in 1975. Absence, myoclonic, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures are its defining features. ## What Is the Etiology Behind Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy? JME is categorized as idiopathic and hereditary (around 50% of cases have a positive family history). Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) still has an elusive specific cause. Genetic factors play a significant role in genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE), which is the name used to describe the complete class of idiopathic (genetic) generalized epilepsies (IGEs). JME is the IGE with the most accurately discovered particular mutations in a variety of genes. Its route of inheritance is complicated, and numerous genes most likely contribute to a comparable electroclinical condition. Ion channel gene mutations, such as those in the chloride channel (CLCN2), GABA receptor subunit (GABRA1), and beta-4 calcium channel subunit (CACNB4), have been linked to JME. These channelopathies are all uncommon causes of JME, and each has only been documented in a single family. The most frequent gene mutation discovered thus far in research on families with JME is in 3FHC1, a gene involved in cortical genesis throughout brain development. Dysfunction in afflicted patients with JME and an EFHC1 gene mutation may be caused by calcium dysregulation rather than anomalies during cortical development. Researchers are

most frequent gene mutation discovered thus far in research on families with JME is in 3FHC1, a gene involved in cortical genesis throughout brain development. Dysfunction in afflicted patients with JME and an EFHC1 gene mutation may be caused by calcium dysregulation rather than anomalies during cortical development. Researchers are also looking into gene malfunction at other loci (EJM2, EJM3). ## What Is the Epidemiology of Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy? One of the most prevalent childhood or juvenile epilepsy syndromes, JME accounts for five percent to ten percent of all epilepsy cases. JME affects both sexes equally, despite some research claiming that females are likelier to get it. JME typically shows symptoms between the ages of 12 and 18. ## What Is the Pathophysiology of Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy? JME contains both idiopathic and genetic components to its pathogenesis. Although a complex process is suspected, the genetics of inheritance remains poorly understood. Some genes with recognized connections to JME are CACNB4, EFHC1, and GABRA1. There have been reports of structural anomalies as a potential cause of JME, although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is unremarkable in cases with classic JME. **Historical Background:** In most JME patients, seizures begin between 12 and 18, with a mean onset of roughly 15 years. However, with an age range of 5 to 34 years, the beginning can occur sooner or later. As noted in the introduction, absence, myoclonic, and generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures are present in JME. All JME patients experience myoclonic seizures, followed

and 18, with a mean onset of roughly 15 years. However, with an age range of 5 to 34 years, the beginning can occur sooner or later. As noted in the introduction, absence, myoclonic, and generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures are present in JME. All JME patients experience myoclonic seizures, followed by GTC seizures in 85 % to 90 % of cases and absence seizures in roughly 20 % to 40 % of cases. The hallmark of this disorder, myoclonic seizures, is required to diagnose JME. Rarely will they appear to be the only seizure kind. Brief, typically bilateral, jerky movements of the arms and occasionally the legs are described, as well as the retention of consciousness. Myoclonic seizures could be misdiagnosed as twitches, anxiety or nervousness. Myoclonic jerks in clusters become more frequent and intense and frequently develop into GTC seizures. Myoclonic seizures typically start a few months following GTC seizures. ## What Is the Evaluation for Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy? The majority of the information needed to diagnose JME comes from history. In general, physical examinations are unremarkable. For the purpose of diagnosing JME, an electroencephalogram (EEG) is supportive evidence. Nearly all JME patients have aberrant interictal EEGs. A nocturnal and sleep-deprived EEG is abnormal in almost every patient if the routine EEG is normal. The anomalies are primarily noticeable when someone is waking up from sleep. The usual EEG in JME exhibits frontocentral predominance and diffuse, symmetric, bilateral four to six hertz (Hz) polyspike and wave discharges. About half

and sleep-deprived EEG is abnormal in almost every patient if the routine EEG is normal. The anomalies are primarily noticeable when someone is waking up from sleep. The usual EEG in JME exhibits frontocentral predominance and diffuse, symmetric, bilateral four to six hertz (Hz) polyspike and wave discharges. About half of the patient population will have localized or asymmetric problems, and the backdrop has a normal alpha rhythm. Polyspike discharges accompanying myoclonic jerks at 10 to 16 Hz are visible on ictal or continuous EEG recordings. The spikes and myoclonic jerks are correlated. Like other epilepsies, GTC and absence seizures associated with JME include low voltage rapid activity with spike and wave discharges and generalized 3 Hz spike and wave discharges, respectively, on the EEG. Given that JME is known to be photosensitive, photic stimulation increases the yield of the EEG in this condition. ## What Are the Treatment Options for Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy? Anti-epileptic medicines (AEDs) can easily control JME; monotherapy is adequate for most patients. The best medication for treating JME is Valproic acid, the drug of preference. It is a broad-spectrum drug that manages all JME seizure types. Given its well-known teratogenic potential, its use in women of reproductive age requires extreme caution. Levetiracetam, Lamotrigine, Topiramate, and Zonisamide are further therapeutic choices. Lamotrigine can exacerbate myoclonic seizures, yet it is frequently used to treat JME because it manages other seizure types. Ethosuximide can be used as a treatment option if only absence seizures are detected. Myoclonic jerks

of reproductive age requires extreme caution. Levetiracetam, Lamotrigine, Topiramate, and Zonisamide are further therapeutic choices. Lamotrigine can exacerbate myoclonic seizures, yet it is frequently used to treat JME because it manages other seizure types. Ethosuximide can be used as a treatment option if only absence seizures are detected. Myoclonic jerks can be prevented by using Clonazepam. Among the contraindicated medications include Phenytoin (a sodium channel blocker), Oxcarbazepine, and Carbamazepine is given which can make absence and myoclonic seizures worse. However, they may be effective in the management of JME GTC seizures. Vigabatrin, Tiagabine, Gabapentin, Pregabalin, and Primidone are further drugs to stay away from. Only a few people with JME experience persistent disease, and in these patients, combination therapy with or without vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) may be an option. ## What Is the Prognosis of Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy? In most JME patients, seizures are typically well controlled with medication, and they typically improve during the fourth decade of life. However, JME requires lifetime treatment (even after a lengthy period without seizures), as the likelihood of return is significant if medication is stopped. **Conclusion** While a neurologist oversees most JME management, the primary care or nurse practitioner typically does follow-up. The inter-professional team's patient education efforts are essential for seizure prevention. Chemists should inform patients and their families of the significance of compliance and side effects. Neuroscience nurses monitor patients, educate others, and update the team on any changes to their conditions. Avoiding precipitating variables and triggers needs to be

The inter-professional team's patient education efforts are essential for seizure prevention. Chemists should inform patients and their families of the significance of compliance and side effects. Neuroscience nurses monitor patients, educate others, and update the team on any changes to their conditions. Avoiding precipitating variables and triggers needs to be a top priority. Avoiding alcohol use, exhaustion, stress, lack of sleep, any flashing light, non-compliance with medicine, hunger, temperature extremes, and drug use are a few of these. Additionally, patients should be instructed about the dangers of driving, operating heavy equipment, swimming, avoiding heights, and being alone near a fire. Because there is a substantial risk of return if medication is stopped, the treatment is typically lifelong (even after a lengthy period of seizure- free time). The dangers vs. benefits of taking drugs while pregnant should be thoroughly discussed with the patient, as with any epilepsy syndrome. </content> </article> <article> <slug>carbamazepine-overdose</slug> <content>**Introduction** Carbamazepine can be used alone or in combination with other drugs to treat seizures in epilepsy patients.

It can happen due to accidental ingestion of large doses or may be due to long-term exposure to drug doses more than needed. Toxicity due to drug overdose may cause drowsiness, imbalance, abnormal cardiac conduction, dizziness, and coma. Toxic effects associated with Carbamazepine overdose are aggravated when the drug is taken in combination with other anti-epileptic drugs (Lamotrigine). ## What Are Carbamazepines? Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant medication used to treat neuropathic pain and epilepsy. Swiss chemist Walter Schindler discovered it in the year 1953. Carbamazepine is considered a generic drug and is one of the drugs on the world health organization's list of essential medicines. Carbamazepine is available as tablets (100 milligrams, 200 milligrams), suspensions,extended- release tablets (100 milligrams, 200 milligrams, 300 milligrams, 400 milligrams), and solutions. They exert therapeutic effects by modulating the voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC). These modulations cause reduced synaptic transmission and inhibition of action potential. Carbamazepine inactivates sodium channels and prevents the generation of an action potential. ## What Are the Uses of Carbamazepine? Carbamazepine can be used alone or in combination with other drugs to manage seizures in epileptic patients (generalized tonic seizures, partial seizures, mixed seizures), trigeminal neuralgia, bipolar disorder (mixed and acute manic type), schizophrenia, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, restless leg syndrome, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and dementia (to reduce aggression and agitation). ## What Are the Side Effects of Using Carbamazepine?

type), schizophrenia, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, restless leg syndrome, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and dementia (to reduce aggression and agitation). ## What Are the Side Effects of Using Carbamazepine? In some people, Carbamazepine use may result in dangerous allergic reactions called toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). These life-threatening allergic reactions cause severe damage to the internal organs and skin. Therefore, proper allergic drug history must be made before starting Carbamazepine medication. Other side effects observed after Carbamazepine use are the following. * Dry mouth. * Dizziness. * Nausea. * Confusion. * Vomiting. * Fatigue. * Vision changes. * Headache. * Skin rashes. * Facial swellings. * Loss of appetite. * Reduced blood cell count. * Dark urine. * Swollen eyes. * Stomach pain. * Gastric ulcers. * Muscle pain. * Mouth sores. * Generalized weakness. * Skin blisters. * Yellow skin. ## What Is Carbamazepine Toxicity? Carbamazepine overdose results in central nervous system depression and adverse effects. These drugs have a high volume of distribution and protein binding capacity. Hence they can remain in the tissues in a bound form with plasma proteins. After reaching the tissues, they readily get absorbed and enter the bloodstream. Carbamazepine is oxidized to a metabolite known as Carbamazepine epoxide and exerts toxic effects. Other Carbamazepine derivatives like dihydroxy epoxide are also involved in toxicity-related adverse effects. Poisonous effects observed after ingestion depends on the amount of Carbamazepine. The table given below shows the impact observed on different levels of Carbamazepine. ![Carbamazepine dose](https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.icliniq.com/infographics/impact- observed-on-different-levels-of-carbamazepine.png)

Clinical symptoms associated with toxicity develop within one to two hours for immediate-release tablets and four to eight hours for sustained-release tablets. Toxicity and severity of symptoms depend on drug concentration and patient response. The common symptoms associated with Carbamazepine overdose are the following. * Drowsiness. * Restlessness. * Unconsciousness. * Dizziness. * Muscle twitching. * Vision changes. * Nausea. * Sedation. * Abnormal movements. * Rapid heartbeat. * Vomiting. * Unsteadiness. * Irregular breathing. * Difficulty in urination. * Slow breathing. * Cardiac arrhythmias (life-threatening). * Seizures. * Ataxia. * Coma. ## How Can We Manage Carbamazepine Toxicity? * **Gastrointestinal Decontamination** \- Gastric lavage can be done in cases of Carbamazepine toxicity to eliminate the ingested toxins when the patient is admitted into the hospital within a few hours. Activated charcoal can be used to prevent absorption and reduce toxicity. It binds to Carbamazepine molecules and prevents gastrointestinal absorption of the drug. In addition to that, activated charcoal interrupts the enterohepatic circulation of Carbamazepine and enhances drug elimination. Gastric decontamination using activated charcoal poses the risk of charcoal aspiration in patients with an altered unconscious and mental status due to overdose.

In addition to that, activated charcoal interrupts the enterohepatic circulation of Carbamazepine and enhances drug elimination. Gastric decontamination using activated charcoal poses the risk of charcoal aspiration in patients with an altered unconscious and mental status due to overdose. Charcoal hemoperfusion can also be done in patients to enhance Carbamazepine elimination and improve clinical outcomes. * **Enhanced Elimination** \- Repeated use of activated charcoal is done to enhance the elimination of ingested toxins. It can be achieved using multiple-dose activated charcoal (MDAC). * **Intravenous Fluids** \- Fluid resuscitation must be done in patients with Carbamazepine toxicity to manage hypotension and hypovolemia. * **Hemodialysis** \- In cases of fatal Carbamazepine poisoning, toxic metabolites like Carbamazepine epoxide can be eliminated from the blood using hemodialysis. This technique purifies toxin-loaded blood from the body using a hemodialysis machine. Thus toxic effects associated with drug overdose can be managed to desired levels. * **Intravenous Lipid Emulsion (ILE)** \- Lipid emulsions can also be used in cases of severe Carbamazepine toxicity to reduce neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity. * **Venovenous Hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF)** \- It is done mainly in pediatric patients following Carbamazepine toxicity. Children are at high risk for developing severe adverse effects after a Carbamazepine overdose. Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration can be done to enhance the clearance of toxins. In this technique, diffusion and convection techniques are used to increase the volume of ultrafiltrate and thereby enhance the clearance rate. It can also be performed in

In this technique, diffusion and convection techniques are used to increase the volume of ultrafiltrate and thereby enhance the clearance rate. It can also be performed in unstable adult patients to reduce toxicity. * **Sodium Bicarbonate** \- Ventricular dysrhythmia due to Carbamazepine toxicity can be managed with sodium bicarbonate. * **Benzodiazepines** \- Intravenous administration of benzodiazepine drugs can manage seizures associated with Carbamazepine toxicity. Drugs such as Lorazepam, Midazolam, and Diazepam are commonly used. **Conclusion:** Carbamazepine drugs are commonly used to manage seizures in epilepsy patients. They are one of the most commonly used drugs in the world. Hence drug overdose and toxicity associated with Carbamazepine medications are also common. Neurotoxicity associated with Carbamazepine overdose may cause altered consciousness, confusion, loss of muscle balance, depression, and respiratory arrest. Immediate hospital admission must be made after a Carbamazepine overdose to avoid life-threatening complications. Enhanced drug elimination techniques will help to remove the ingested toxins and reduce symptoms to a certain extent. Other clinical symptoms associated with Carbamazepine overdose can be managed with necessary medical treatment. </content> </article> <article> <slug>what-exactly-is-epilepsy</slug> <content>## What Is Epilepsy?

<slug>what-exactly-is-epilepsy</slug> <content>## What Is Epilepsy? Epilepsy is a group of neurological disorders in which there are abnormal electrical activities in the brain causing a brief disruption in the communication system of the brain cells. Epilepsy has trademark symptoms of seizures. A seizure is a sudden rise in the electrical activity of the brain. It can involve a part of the brain or the entire brain. It results in episodes of unusual behavior, loss of awareness, and can affect both males and females of any age. The symptoms can vary, as some people just stare blankly for some time and others have jerky arms or legs twitches. For it to be diagnosed as epilepsy, you have to have at least two unprovoked seizures. Medications (mostly lifelong) or surgery are used in the management of most cases of epilepsy. In children, epilepsy may go away as they age. ## What Are the Types of Seizures? **The types of seizures are:** **1) Partial Seizures** : Otherwise called focal seizures. In this type, the electrical activity takes place in a localized area of the brain. This could be - * **Simple Partial Seizures -** It is now called focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Here, the patient is conscious during the seizure episode. * **Complex Partial Seizures -** It is now called focal seizure with impaired awareness. Here, the patient becomes unconscious during the episode. A doctor needs to thoroughly diagnose partial seizures, as they are commonly confused with narcolepsy, migraine, or other mental

Here, the patient is conscious during the seizure episode. * **Complex Partial Seizures -** It is now called focal seizure with impaired awareness. Here, the patient becomes unconscious during the episode. A doctor needs to thoroughly diagnose partial seizures, as they are commonly confused with narcolepsy, migraine, or other mental disorders. **2) Generalized seizures** : Where the abnormal electrical activity takes place in the entire brain. Further types include - * **Tonic-Clonic -** Previously it was called grand mal seizures. They result in loss of consciousness, body shaking, muscle stiffening, and loss of bladder control. * **Tonic Seizures -** It results in muscle stiffening and commonly affects the muscles of the back, arms, and legs. * **Clonic Seizures -** They cause rhythmic and jerking movements. * **Atonic Seizures -** Also called drop seizures, as it results in loss of muscle control, which causes a sudden fall. * **Absence Seizures -** Previously it was called petit mal seizures. This often occurs in children. It is characterized by a brief loss of awareness and staring blankly. * **Myoclonic seizures****-** This causes brief twitches in the arms and legs. ## When to Consult a Doctor for a Seizure? In the following situation, make sure you get immediate medical help: * If the seizures last for more than 5 minutes. * If breathing does not return to normal after a seizure. * If the person is still unconscious. * If a second seizure occurs immediately. * If you are pregnant. * If you are

sure you get immediate medical help: * If the seizures last for more than 5 minutes. * If breathing does not return to normal after a seizure. * If the person is still unconscious. * If a second seizure occurs immediately. * If you are pregnant. * If you are diabetic. * In case of an injury during the seizure. * If this was your first seizure. ## What Are the Causes of Epilepsy? In more than 50 % of cases, the cause of epilepsy cannot be determined. Various causes can lead to seizures and some of the possible causes are: * Brain scarring after an injury. * Very high fever. * Traumatic brain injury. * Stroke and other vascular diseases. * Injury to developing brain in the fetus or brain malformation. * Reduced oxygen supply at birth. * Maternal drug use. * Brain tumor. * Dementia. * Alzheimerâ€™s disease. * Reduced oxygen supply to the brain. * Other neurological conditions. * Infectious diseases (AIDS). * Brain infections (meningitis or encephalitis). * Alcohol withdrawal. * Genetic factors. ## What Are the Symptoms of a Seizure? Symptoms can differ from one person to another. For this reason, the list has varying possibilities of symptoms that can exist alone or together. They can include the following. Convulsions. * Twitching of limbs. * Involuntary, repetitive movements. * Staring. * Sudden stiffening. * Short fainting spell. * Being unresponsive. * Appear dazed. * Jerky movements. * Taste and smell disturbance. * Confusion after the

Convulsions. * Twitching of limbs. * Involuntary, repetitive movements. * Staring. * Sudden stiffening. * Short fainting spell. * Being unresponsive. * Appear dazed. * Jerky movements. * Taste and smell disturbance. * Confusion after the episode. ### Triggering Factors: Knowing your trigger will help in the prevention of episodes. It could be one or a combination of the following. 1. Skipping food. 2. Lack of sleep. 3. Being sick. 4. Stress. 5. Flashing lights. 6. Certain drugs. 7. Specific food items. ## How Is Epilepsy Diagnosed? The doctor will need your medical history and the list of symptoms that you are experiencing. Then the doctor will try to diagnose epilepsy and rule out all other possible conditions by the following tests: 1. **Neurological Examination - T** o test motor and mental functions. 2. **Blood Tests -** To rule out infectious diseases, and to check blood sugar levels. They might also check the liver and kidney functions. 3. **Electroencephalogram (EEG) -** Here, electrodes are used to record the electrical activity of the brain. 4. **CT (Computerized Tomography) scan or MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) -** Here, detailed images of the brain are obtained. It is used to diagnose conditions like tumors and cysts. 5. **Neuropsychological Tests -** Your thinking, memory and speech skills are assessed in this test, which helps the doctor determine the areas of your brain that are affected. 6. **Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) -**

Some of the commonly used treatment options include: 1. **Anticonvulsant or Anti-epileptic Medications -** It helps reduce the number of seizures. The drugs used are Levetiracetam, Lamotrigine, and Valproic acid. 2. **Vagus Nerve stimulator** \- The vagus nerve is stimulated using a surgically placed device. 3. **Ketogenic Diet -** Most people are benefited from the ketogenic diet, which is a high fat, low carbohydrate diet. 4. **Brain Surgery -** If the patient does not respond to medications, the area of the brain responsible for seizure activity is altered or removed. ## What Are the Possible Complications of Epilepsy? The consequences of seizures are more dangerous and difficult to treat than the disease itself. It includes: * Injury due to fall. * Drowning if there is a seizure while swimming. * Road accidents due to loss of control when driving. * Side effects of anti-epileptic medications on mental health. * Seizures during pregnancy can adversely affect the health of the mother and her baby. * Brain damage due to repeated abnormal electrical activities. * Minor risk of death due

swimming. * Road accidents due to loss of control when driving. * Side effects of anti-epileptic medications on mental health. * Seizures during pregnancy can adversely affect the health of the mother and her baby. * Brain damage due to repeated abnormal electrical activities. * Minor risk of death due to heart or airway complications. * Status epilepticus - It is when a continuous seizure activity lasts for more than 5 minutes. Status epilepticus increases the risk of permanent brain damage and death. * SUDEP - Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy. If this is the first episode of seizure, it is imperative to get to an ER as quickly as possible. If you have been previously diagnosed with epilepsy, an increase in the frequency of seizures or a change in symptoms is an indicator that it is time to visit your neurologist for a follow-up and update in medication or dosage. **Conclusion:** In conclusion, repeated seizures are the hallmark of the complicated neurological condition known as epilepsy. The ability to diagnose, treat, and manage this disorder has considerably improved despite the fact that the precise underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. People with epilepsy can improve seizure control and quality of life with a personalized approach to medicines, lifestyle changes, and supportive therapy.

Epilepsy is a condition that is still being researched and treated more thoroughly because of ongoing medical study and collaboration. </content> </article> <article> <slug>neurological-problems-affecting-pregnancy</slug> <content>**Introduction** The pregnant state can affect many neurological diseases, while certain neurologic diseases or treatments significantly negatively affect pregnancy, labor, or delivery. Some conditions are unique to a pregnancy and postpartum states, such as eclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy, which occurs after pre-eclampsia) and delivery-associated neuropathies. Many neurological diseases can lead to devastating complications if not recognized early. Some conditions like preeclampsia (high blood pressure 20 weeks after pregnancy) are recognized by obstetricians and managed without significant neurological input unless seizures develop. Hypertension is one of the common medical pregnancy complications and contributes significantly to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. The hypertensive disorders that cause neurological problems during pregnancy are, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension. ## What Are the Objectives of Early Diagnosis Complications of Pregnancy? The following are the objectives of the diagnosis of early pregnancy: * Understanding the complications of hypertension during pregnancy. * Predictions and prevention of these complications. * Early identification and appropriate management. * Problem-based learning. ## What Are the Neurological Problems That Are Common in Pregnancy? The most common neurological problems during pregnancy are: * Migraine. * Eclampsia. * Preeclampsia. * Epilepsy. * Multiple sclerosis. * Myasthenia gravis. ## How Is Pregnancy Affected by Epilepsy?

## What Are the Neurological Problems That Are Common in Pregnancy? The most common neurological problems during pregnancy are: * Migraine. * Eclampsia. * Preeclampsia. * Epilepsy. * Multiple sclerosis. * Myasthenia gravis. ## How Is Pregnancy Affected by Epilepsy? It is a neurological disorder that involves recurrent seizures. It is difficult to predict how pregnancy affects epilepsy. However, some may experience frequent seizures while they are pregnant. The reason is that the medications used to treat epilepsy may work differently during pregnancy or may not be absorbed well. The physical and emotional stress that comes with pregnancy is also considered a potent trigger. On the other hand, epilepsy poses certain risks to pregnancy. Besides the general complications of the condition, the medications used to treat it can also adversely affect the mother, the unborn baby, and the pregnancy. Since women are more delicate while pregnant, having a seizure disorder heightens the risk of injuries and complications. Meanwhile, the type of medications may have serious side effects on the baby, such as abnormalities to the heart, slightly smaller size, congenital disabilities (for example, cleft lip or cleft palate), or stillbirths. In addition, the risks to the pregnancy itself may result in the premature separation of the placenta from the uterus, premature labor, and miscarriages. Pregnant women with epilepsy need close monitoring of the disease and fetal health, so more frequent prenatal visits are needed. Most women will be prescribed anticonvulsant medications. Proper monitoring also ensures that seizures and side effects

in the premature separation of the placenta from the uterus, premature labor, and miscarriages. Pregnant women with epilepsy need close monitoring of the disease and fetal health, so more frequent prenatal visits are needed. Most women will be prescribed anticonvulsant medications. Proper monitoring also ensures that seizures and side effects are reduced. The goal of treatment is to use as few medications as possible at the lowest dose necessary to control these seizures. There is also a need to increase the folic acid dosage in pregnant women with epilepsy. This prenatal vitamin is routinely prescribed to all pregnant women to reduce the risk of babies defecting to the spine, heart, and limbs. However, there is a need to prescribe a higher dose because epilepsy medications can interfere with folic acid absorption increasing the risk of the baby being born with spinal abnormalities. ## Why Do Pregnant Women Get Migraines? The surge of hormones and increased blood volume often result in frequent headaches in pregnant women. Tension headaches are very common in pregnancy that causes mild to moderate pressing pain on both sides of the head. It resolves within a few minutes or hours or lasts several days. Migraines are not typical headaches. Migraine is a unilateral and often throbbing pain associated with nausea and sensitivity to light, sound, head movement, blurred vision, numbness, light flashes, or tingling on the face, arms, or leg. Migraine headache is a significant health problem affecting women more than men. The hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy

typical headaches. Migraine is a unilateral and often throbbing pain associated with nausea and sensitivity to light, sound, head movement, blurred vision, numbness, light flashes, or tingling on the face, arms, or leg. Migraine headache is a significant health problem affecting women more than men. The hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy and lactation affect the frequency and magnitude of migraines. Migraine attacks often increase in frequency in the first trimester but can be expected to decrease later in pregnancy. The attacks are less frequent in the second and third trimesters. The causes of migraine during pregnancy include: * Lack of sleep. * Low blood sugar. * Dehydration. * Stress. * The surge of hormones. * Increase in blood volume. Headaches during the third trimester are related to poor posture and tension due to extra weight and conditions like preeclampsia. The aggravating factors of headaches include- stress, lack of sleep, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, sinus congestion, or nasal stuffiness. Pregnancy-induced hypertension, poor nutrition, low blood sugar levels. ## What Are Eclampsia and Its Health Impact During Pregnancy? Eclampsia is an acute and life-threatening complication during pregnancy, usually in patients with preeclampsia, characterized by hypertension, edema (accumulation of excess fluid in the body), protein in urine involving convulsions, and coma is called eclampsia. The types of eclampsia include: 1. Antepartum 50 %. 2. Intrapartum 30 %. 3. Postpartum 20 % usually within 48 hours. **What Is the Pathophysiology of Eclampsia?** The pathophysiology of eclampsia is as follows: * Preeclampsia is called eclampsia when complicated

in urine involving convulsions, and coma is called eclampsia. The types of eclampsia include: 1. Antepartum 50 %. 2. Intrapartum 30 %. 3. Postpartum 20 % usually within 48 hours. **What Is the Pathophysiology of Eclampsia?** The pathophysiology of eclampsia is as follows: * Preeclampsia is called eclampsia when complicated with generalized tonic-clonic convulsions and coma. * It is considered a complication of preeclampsia. * These seizures can cause confusion and disorientation or lead to coma. In some cases, it can lead to stroke or death. * Preeclampsia can also become serious, affecting the patient's brain function and causing seizures or coma. In this condition, the blood pressure exceeds 160 by 110 mmHg (millimeters of mercury). * The protein in the urine is because of portal hypertension (high pressure in the kidney blood vessels) or sometimes kidney failure. * Because of edema and proteinuria, there is increased blood pressure (hypertension). * Hypertension leads to the poor blood supply to the brain. The brain cells are deprived of proper oxygen supply, which disturbs the brain's normal functions. * High blood pressure causes pressure on the blood vessels. There can be swelling in the brain, which may lead to seizures. The brain produces excessive electrical impulses or stimuli called a seizure. **What Are the Symptoms of Eclampsia?** The symptoms include: * Seizures. * Severe distress or confusion. * Losing consciousness. * Severe general edema. * Hypertension. * Intracranial hemorrhage is rare. Yet potentially devastating event in pregnancy. There is a risk of

Yet potentially devastating event in pregnancy. There is a risk of maternal mortality or morbidity and a significant risk to the unborn child. The risk of bleeding increases during the third trimester and is greatest during parturition and the puerperium. **Complications of Hypertension During Pregnancy** The fetal complications due to hypertension are: * Intrapartum fetal diseases. * Preterm delivery. * Placental abruption. * Increases the risk of cesarean section. * Hypoxic neurological injury. * Premature labor. * Stillbirth. Acute complications of hypertension during pregnancy include: * Central nervous system complications, including eclampsia. * Acute respiratory failure. ## What Are Preeclampsia and Its Neurological Impacts on Pregnant Women? Preeclampsia is a condition in pregnant women characterized by high blood pressure levels, high protein release in the urine (proteinuria), and swelling in the feet, legs, and hands. It is one of the main causes of maternal death in the United States. Preeclampsia is sometimes referred to as toxemia. * The condition is characterized by elevated blood pressure midway through pregnancy, usually after 20 weeks. It may occur earlier as well but most commonly occurs in late pregnancy. Women with normal blood pressure experience a sudden spike in blood pressure when they are 20 weeks or more than 20 weeks pregnant. Women with diabetes

by elevated blood pressure midway through pregnancy, usually after 20 weeks. It may occur earlier as well but most commonly occurs in late pregnancy. Women with normal blood pressure experience a sudden spike in blood pressure when they are 20 weeks or more than 20 weeks pregnant. Women with diabetes or obesity are at higher risk of developing preeclampsia. In the United States, African women are at higher risk of developing this condition than Caucasian women. It also affects the lower socio-economic populations more. * The diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia are proteinuria, edema, and hypertension. * Pregnant women experience elevated blood pressure (equal to or exceeding 140 by 90 mmHg). * It can occur regardless of the previous history of high blood pressure or preeclampsia. * High blood pressure decreases the blood supply to the baby, which may cause less oxygen and nutrients. It affects the placenta, impairs liver function, and causes lung fluid accumulation. Premature babies are at risk for complications like low birth weight and respiratory problems. * The comparatively milder form of this condition is gestational hypertension, which may develop into preeclampsia. * The symptoms of eclampsia last for 6 to 12 weeks after delivery and resolve independently. * In mild preeclampsia, the diastolic blood pressure is above 90 mmHg but less than 110 mmHg and the systolic blood pressure is 140 mmHg. The mean arterial blood pressure exceeds 105 mmHg. * In severe preeclampsia, the systolic blood pressure is more than 160 mmHg, or diastolic blood

The mean arterial blood pressure exceeds 105 mmHg. * In severe preeclampsia, the systolic blood pressure is more than 160 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure is more than 110 mmHg. * Proteinuria exceeds five grams per 24 hours. ## How Does Multiple Sclerosis Affect Pregnancy? Multiple sclerosis is a disorder that leads to problems in the central nervous system, the brain, and the spinal cord; in this disease, the body attacks the myelin sheath, an outer coating that protects the nerve cells. It is an autoimmune condition. When it gets damaged, the flow of information between the brain and the rest of the body gets disrupted. This leads to common neurological symptoms such as loss of coordination, muscle weakness, and trouble with sensation. Having multiple sclerosis does not seem to affect getting pregnant, nor does pregnancy speed up the course or worsen the effect of multiple sclerosis. The nine months of pregnancy are generally associated with fewer relapses. Those with unrecognized multiple sclerosis before getting pregnant are more likely to start experiencing symptoms during pregnancy. However, within three to six months after delivery, the symptoms tend to flare up again. Due to debilitating symptoms, it may be physically challenging for the patients to carry a pregnancy. It increases the likelihood of injuries due to muscle weakness and coordination problems. Furthermore, delivery becomes difficult as

pregnancy. However, within three to six months after delivery, the symptoms tend to flare up again. Due to debilitating symptoms, it may be physically challenging for the patients to carry a pregnancy. It increases the likelihood of injuries due to muscle weakness and coordination problems. Furthermore, delivery becomes difficult as the muscles and nerves needed for pushing are also affected. This is why these patients usually undergo a C-section (Caesarean section), vacuum, or forceps delivery. ## How Does Myasthenia Gravis Affect Pregnancy? Myasthenia gravis (MG) is another autoimmune disorder that causes weakness in the skeletal muscles of the face and extremities. It worsens after periods of activity and improves after periods of rest. It usually affects women in their 20s and 30s or during childbearing. Myasthenia gravis tends to worsen during the first trimester and postpartum period. The course of the disease varies, and pregnant women risk getting worse, respiratory failure, adverse drug reactions, a myasthenic crisis, and even death. Pregnancy does not appear to worsen the long-term effects of myasthenia gravis on women. Vaginal delivery is safe, and it should be encouraged. A C-section is carried out only when needed because surgery is associated with the worsening of myasthenia gravis and might even result in a myasthenic crisis. Since the uterine muscles are composed of smooth muscles, their ability to contract is not compromised with myasthenia gravis. Therefore, the first stage of labor is not affected. But as the woman progresses to the second stage of labor, she will

gravis and might even result in a myasthenic crisis. Since the uterine muscles are composed of smooth muscles, their ability to contract is not compromised with myasthenia gravis. Therefore, the first stage of labor is not affected. But as the woman progresses to the second stage of labor, she will need the striated muscles to work. This can be exhausting, and it often requires forceps or vacuum extraction. **Conclusion:** Neurologic disorders may come with symptoms that can make pregnancy more challenging, even to the point of being risky. However, it does not mean that having these conditions can rob a woman of bearing a child. Preparation, precaution, and close monitoring make it possible to have a safe pregnancy. </content> </article> <article> <slug>psychogenic-non-epileptic-seizures</slug> <content>**Introduction** Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures result in an attack similar to epilepsy- related seizure, which is caused due to physiological problems and not by electrical brain activity. This condition shows symptoms and signs similar to seizure, and treatment associated with seizure will not help this condition. This condition can be treated through psychotherapy. ## What Is Meant by Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures? Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, also known as pseudo seizures, resemble a seizure but are not. This condition shows symptoms similar to seizures but does not occur due to any brain electrical activity. Instead, it is caused due to physiological issues. The psychiatric diagnosis of this condition is categorized as conversion disorder (also called a functional neurological symptom), as mental stress or pressure is displayed as physical symptoms.

similar to seizures but does not occur due to any brain electrical activity. Instead, it is caused due to physiological issues. The psychiatric diagnosis of this condition is categorized as conversion disorder (also called a functional neurological symptom), as mental stress or pressure is displayed as physical symptoms. People affected by Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures will have experienced trauma. These people do not fake seizures as they do not have conscious or voluntary control. About 10 % to 15 % of people can have both PNES and epilepsies associated with seizures. ## What Is the Causative Factor of Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures? Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures are seen in people who have experienced stress, trauma, or other mental health issues. This can be caused due to any signal stressful event or long-term traumatic condition. People affected by this condition do not consciously pretend to have seizures and are unaware of the events that occur during seizure episodes. Some of the common causes include: * Past history of personality disorder. * Post-traumatic stress condition. * Dissociative disorder is a mental condition that causes detachment between thoughts, memories, and actions. * Anxiety. * Depression or stress. * History of physical abuse. * Family issues. * History of traumatic brain injury. * Substance use. * Withdrawal issue or anger. Conversion disorder is a condition where the mental health disorder is displayed as physical symptoms. Some physical conditions, such as long-term pain, can enhance the risk of Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures (PNES). ## Who Is More Affected by

History of traumatic brain injury. * Substance use. * Withdrawal issue or anger. Conversion disorder is a condition where the mental health disorder is displayed as physical symptoms. Some physical conditions, such as long-term pain, can enhance the risk of Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures (PNES). ## Who Is More Affected by Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures? Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures can occur at any age, affecting women more than men. Some factor that enhances the risk of a person experiencing PNES are, * Person with a history of sexual abuse. * Individuals having experienced physical abuse in the past. * Psychiatric condition like * Depressive condition. * Post-traumatic stress. * Personality disorder. * Suppression of emotion or stress. About 20 % to 40 % who think they have a seizure are diagnosed with PNES. ## What Signs and Symptoms Are Associated With Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures? An important symptom of PNES is the occurrence of seizure-like episodes, which can vary in intensity, frequency, and pattern from person to person. They look very similar to epilepsies related to seizures, but they are caused due to emotional stress. Some people afflicted with this condition will have a false thought of having a tonic-clonic seizure where the whole body goes under spasm or shaking. Some others may experience small movements of jerking or twitching. Some people mimic absence seizures, where there will be a disconnect or lapse of attention. People affected by PNES can display any seizure-like episode. Some Common Symptoms Are: * Suddenly the person becomes unresponsive.

body goes under spasm or shaking. Some others may experience small movements of jerking or twitching. Some people mimic absence seizures, where there will be a disconnect or lapse of attention. People affected by PNES can display any seizure-like episode. Some Common Symptoms Are: * Suddenly the person becomes unresponsive. * Alteration in consciousness. * Shaking or jerk movements. * Displaying cycling movements. * Closure of the eyes. * Movement of the head from side to side. * Clenching the teeth. Some of the signs where the person displays symptoms related to PNES rather than seizures are: * The affected person may show symptoms of wild thrashing. * Head movements. * The affected people shout out phrases. * The eyes and mouth are closed, and the person resists opening them during the episode. * The person shows the response to loud noise or music. * There would be no drowsiness left by the person post-episode. ## How Is PNES Diagnosed? It is challenging for doctors to diagnose PNES just by observation and the symptoms experienced by the affected person as the signs and symptoms of both epilepsy associated with seizure and PNES are very similar. Most of the time, PNES is misdiagnosed as a seizure. The doctors usually recommend EEG (electroencephalogram) to diagnose the PNES condition. This procedure places a metal disc called the electrode over the scalp. A machine is attached to these electrodes, which monitors the brain activity. This is the most effective way to diagnose PNES, as

is misdiagnosed as a seizure. The doctors usually recommend EEG (electroencephalogram) to diagnose the PNES condition. This procedure places a metal disc called the electrode over the scalp. A machine is attached to these electrodes, which monitors the brain activity. This is the most effective way to diagnose PNES, as it records brain activity during seizure-like episodes. In the case of PNES, brain activity is normal, as no electrical activity is responsible for the PNES condition. The doctors also rule out other conditions responsible for such episodes. These are: * Sleep disorders. * Movement issues. * Partial seizure. * Absence seizure. * Fainting. * Vertigo. Most of the affected people diagnosed with seizures, where the medications recommended will not show any results. These medications can cause harm if they are not needed to be taken. A group of psychologists, psychiatrists, and neurologists will help to find the appropriate diagnosis and treatment. ## How Can Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures Be Managed? Anti-seizure drugs will not help to deal with the symptoms of PNES. This condition can be treated only when the underlying mental condition is treated. The best way to treat the symptoms of PNES is psychotherapy, also known as talk therapy. In this, there are sessions where the affected person talks out with a mental health professional like a psychologist. In these sessions, they discuss the situations that trigger emotional stress. The therapist helps to deal with the stressful condition more effectively. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the best

The therapist helps to deal with the stressful condition more effectively. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the best methods for treating PNES, a form of psychotherapy. The therapies related to PNES focus on the following: * Educating the person regarding the type of seizure. * Identifying and preventing the trigger factors. * The past or present stressful condition that affects the seizure. * Relaxation training to enhance emotion management. ## How Are Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures Prevented? There is no particular way to prevent the occurrence of PNES. Addressing the underlying mental health condition can help to prevent this condition. Counseling or therapy sessions related to mental issues, like talk therapy exercises or relaxation practice, can help. ## What Is the Outlook of Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures? Any people who experience seizures frequently and the anti-seizure drugs do not cause any help should consult a doctor. If the person is affected by PNES, an alternative treatment can help. In the case of PNES, most affected people will not experience any seizure episodes after the diagnosis. So accepting the diagnosis can help significantly in preventing the occurrence of seizures. Addressing and treating the mental health condition responsible for PNES will also help greatly. **Conclusion** PNES is characterized by episodes resembling seizures, which are not attributable to abnormal brain electrical activity but

This condition can be misdiagnosed as a seizure, and the doctors may recommend anti-seizure drugs, which will not help to manage this condition. Psychotherapy or CBT is the best mode of treatment in treating this condition. </content> </article> <article> <slug>surgery-for-drug-resistant-epilepsy</slug> <content>**Introduction** Approximately one-third of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy do not obtain appropriate seizure control while receiving optimum medication, which presents substantial hurdles in therapeutic care. Surgical procedures provide a potential route for better results and a higher standard of living for these patients. Drug-resistant epilepsy patients must undergo a thorough assessment of their clinical history, seizure semiology, neuroimaging results, and electrophysiological data before deciding whether they should undergo surgery. Multidisciplinary teams of neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuropsychologists, and radiologists develop customized treatment regimens based on each patient's needs. Treatment options for drug-resistant epilepsy include a range of surgical procedures such as neuromodulatory techniques like vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), responsive neurostimulation (RNS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS), as well as resective surgeries that target the epileptogenic zone (the area of the brain where seizures originate), such as temporal lobectomy (a surgical procedure that involves the removal of a portion of the

as neuromodulatory techniques like vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), responsive neurostimulation (RNS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS), as well as resective surgeries that target the epileptogenic zone (the area of the brain where seizures originate), such as temporal lobectomy (a surgical procedure that involves the removal of a portion of the temporal lobe of the brain), extratemporal resections (involve surgical removal of epileptogenic brain tissue outside the temporal lobe), and hemispherectomy (a surgical procedure where one half (hemisphere) of the brain is either partially or completely removed). Sophisticated neuroimaging techniques, like magnetoencephalography (MEG), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), enable accurate localization of the epileptogenic focus, guiding the surgical procedure and enhancing postoperative results. Effective surgical treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy tries to improve overall quality of life and treat related comorbidities, in addition to reducing seizure burden. However, deciding whether to proceed with surgery requires carefully weighing the expected advantages of seizure freedom and better results against the dangers, which include neurological impairments, infection, and unfavorable anesthetic effects. With improvements in technology, multidisciplinary teamwork, and surgical procedures, the area of epilepsy surgery is constantly evolving, providing promise for better treatment results for those with drug-resistant epilepsy. ## What Is Drug-Resistant Epilepsy? The inability to obtain prolonged seizure freedom after two suitable trials with well-tolerated, carefully selected, and administered antiepileptic drug (AED) regimens is known as medication-resistant epilepsy. This group includes around one-third of epilepsy patients who experience debilitating seizures that severely reduce their

The inability to obtain prolonged seizure freedom after two suitable trials with well-tolerated, carefully selected, and administered antiepileptic drug (AED) regimens is known as medication-resistant epilepsy. This group includes around one-third of epilepsy patients who experience debilitating seizures that severely reduce their quality of life and their capacity to do their daily activities. Drug-resistant epilepsy can have a wide range of underlying etiologies, including structural, genetic, metabolic, and unidentified reasons. Hippocampal sclerosis, cortical dysplasia, tumors, and vascular abnormalities are common structural pathologies. ## What Are the Criteria for Patient Selection for Surgical Intervention in Drug-Resistant Epilepsy? When considering surgery for drug-resistant epilepsy, a thorough assessment that takes into account the patient's medical history, seizure semiology, neuroimaging results, and electrophysiological data is required. The involvement of multidisciplinary epilepsy surgery teams, which include neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuropsychologists, and radiologists, is crucial. Individualized treatment plans are developed through collaboration and customized to the patient's needs and objectives. ## What Are the Surgical Options for Drug-Resistant Epilepsy? Several surgical treatments can be taken into consideration for individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy, in which drugs are unable to control seizures: * **Reconstructive Surgery:** This entails excising the part of the brain that causes seizures. The most common form is temporal lobectomy, which is frequently performed for drug-resistant epilepsy, specifically temporal lobe epilepsy. * **Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT):** A minimally invasive technique called Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT) employs laser radiation to ablate the seizure focus. This method offers

The most common form is temporal lobectomy, which is frequently performed for drug-resistant epilepsy, specifically temporal lobe epilepsy. * **Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT):** A minimally invasive technique called Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT) employs laser radiation to ablate the seizure focus. This method offers a quicker recovery period and is appropriate for individuals whose seizure sources are well-localized. * **Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS):** An implanted gadget called responsive neurostimulation (RNS) tracks brain activity and applies electrical stimulation to prevent seizures in the tracks. This is ideal for individuals whose seizures are localized to one or two regions. * **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS):** An implanted device under the skin in the chest that stimulates the vagus nerve in the neck with electrical pulses to decrease seizure frequency and intensity. * **Corpus Callosotomy:** A corpus callosotomy involves resecting the corpus callosum, which connects the brain's two hemispheres, to stop seizures from spreading. Patients with severe, generalized epilepsy commonly use this. * **Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS):** Electrodes implanted in specific brain areas deliver electrical impulses that modify neuronal activity and lower seizure frequency. ## What Are the Advances in the Surgical Techniques for Treating Drug- Resistant Epilepsy? The field of epilepsy surgery has undergone a revolution driven by advancements in neurophysiology, neuroimaging, and surgical procedures, which have improved the accuracy, safety, and effectiveness of therapies. Accurate identification of the epileptogenic foci and precise detection of minor cortical abnormalities are made possible by high-resolution structural imaging methods like magnetic

Accurate identification of the epileptogenic foci and precise detection of minor cortical abnormalities are made possible by high-resolution structural imaging methods like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Determining the boundaries of the epileptogenic zone is made easier by the additional information that functional imaging modalities, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG), positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), provide on metabolic activity, perfusion, and epileptiform discharges. ## What Are the Outcomes in the Surgical Management of Drug-Resistant Epilepsy? The goal of effective surgical treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy is to minimize neurological impairments and maintain cognitive function while achieving seizure independence or a substantial decrease in the frequency of seizures. Studies have shown that people with epilepsy who have surgery have positive results; a significant number of patients report improvements in their quality of life and long-term seizure control. The choice to continue with surgery, however, must be made after carefully weighing several variables, such as the patient's objectives and preferences, neuroimaging results, epileptic syndrome, and seizure load. Neurological impairments, infection, bleeding, and anesthesia-related side effects are among the risks connected with epilepsy surgery, highlighting the significance of thorough preoperative screening and patient counseling. Furthermore, postoperative seizure persistence or recurrence may require continuous monitoring and optimization of therapeutic approaches, such as medication modifications and additional therapy. **Conclusion** Surgical therapy plays an essential part in

Technological developments, multidisciplinary teamwork, and improved surgical procedures are all contributing to the ongoing improvement of epilepsy surgery, enhancing treatment options and therapeutic outcomes. Epilepsy surgery continues to be at the forefront of epilepsy management, offering specialized treatments for individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy through ongoing research, innovation, and personalized attention. </content> </article> <article> <slug>endoscopic-corpus-callosotomy-and-hemispherotomy</slug> <content>**Introduction:** Epilepsy is a neurological condition distinguished by recurrent seizures that can profoundly affect individuals.

An endoscopic corpus callosotomy is a surgical approach to address severe epilepsy resistant to medications. Through minimally invasive techniques, a neurosurgeon employs specialized instruments and a small camera (endoscope) to reach the brain via minor incisions. The main goal is to deliberately isolate the corpus callosum, a cluster of nerve fibers linking the brain's hemispheres. This intervention curbs the spread of anomalous electrical signals responsible for seizures, resulting in diminished seizure intensity and occurrence.

This intervention curbs the spread of anomalous electrical signals responsible for seizures, resulting in diminished seizure intensity and occurrence. This procedure is considered for individuals whose epilepsy originates in one hemisphere but affects both sides of the brain. ## What Is an Endoscopic Hemispherotomy? An endoscopic hemispherotomy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure to address severe epilepsy originating from a single brain hemisphere. Through a small incision, a slender endoscope with a camera guides the surgeon in disconnecting or extracting a portion of the affected hemisphere. This strategy aims to halt the spread of epileptic signals, lessening seizure frequency and intensity. The procedure's advantages include shorter hospitalization, the fastest recovery, and the potential for enhanced results compared to conventional open surgeries. ## What Is the Difference Between an Endoscopic Callosotomy and an Endoscopic Hemispherotomy? In epilepsy treatment, endoscopic callosotomy and endoscopic hemispherotomy are surgical interventions. They differ in objectives and the brain structures they address. Endoscopic callosotomy entails the division of the corpus callosum, a network of nerve fibers bridging brain hemispheres. This procedure aims to halt the transmission of epileptic activity between hemispheres, thus diminishing the impact of seizures originating in one hemisphere on the other. Primarily explored for generalized seizures with limited medication response. Conversely, endoscopic hemispherotomy zeroes in on severe epilepsy originating from a single hemisphere. During this procedure, a portion of the affected hemisphere

transmission of epileptic activity between hemispheres, thus diminishing the impact of seizures originating in one hemisphere on the other. Primarily explored for generalized seizures with limited medication response. Conversely, endoscopic hemispherotomy zeroes in on severe epilepsy originating from a single hemisphere. During this procedure, a portion of the affected hemisphere is disconnected or removed to stop the spread of epileptic activity. Unlike a callosotomy that maintains both hemispheres, a hemispherotomy aims to isolate the hemisphere generating seizures, reducing frequency and intensity. This procedure is typically considered when the seizures are not well controlled with medication and severely affect the patient's quality of life. In summary, while both procedures involve endoscopic techniques and are used to treat epilepsy, an endoscopic callosotomy severs the corpus callosum to prevent the inter-hemispheric spread of seizures, whereas an endoscopic hemispherotomy disconnects or removes part of a hemisphere to halt seizure activity originating from that specific hemisphere. ## Who Is a Candidate for These Procedures? Individuals who might be suitable candidates for endoscopic corpus callosotomy and endoscopic hemispherotomy are those who have severe epilepsy resistant to medication. These procedures are typically considered when seizures significantly diminish the patient's quality of life, and alternative treatments prove ineffective. Thorough assessments by medical experts are conducted to weigh potential benefits against risks, factoring in epilepsy type, seizure location, overall health, and the extent of impairment caused by seizures. ## What Are the Advantages of Endoscopic Corpus Callosotomy and Hemispherotomy?

Thorough assessments by medical experts are conducted to weigh potential benefits against risks, factoring in epilepsy type, seizure location, overall health, and the extent of impairment caused by seizures. ## What Are the Advantages of Endoscopic Corpus Callosotomy and Hemispherotomy? The advantages of Endoscopic Corpus Callosotomy and Hemispherotomy include the following: **Endoscopic Corpus Callosotomy:** * **Interrupting Seizure Pathway:** Through the division of the corpus callosum, the propagation of seizure activity between brain hemispheres is disrupted, resulting in decreased seizure spread. * **Less Invasive Technique:** Utilizing small incisions and an endoscope equipped with a camera minimizes the requirement for extensive surgical openings, contributing to a more streamlined approach. This results in smaller scars, less pain, and a quicker recovery than traditional open procedures. * **Reduced Hospitalization Period:** The minimally invasive approach of endoscopic corpus callosotomy frequently results in shorter hospital stays, enabling a quicker reintegration into daily routines. * **Enhanced Quality of Life Possibility:** Through diminished seizure frequency and minimized inter-hemispheric activity, individuals have the potential to enjoy an elevated quality of life, marked by improved cognitive abilities and enhanced daily functioning. **Endoscopic Hemispherotomy:** * **Seizure Control:** Endoscopic hemispherotomy aims to disconnect or remove the hemisphere causing seizures. This can significantly reduce seizure frequency and intensity, improving the patient's overall well-being. * **Minimally Invasive Techniques:** Similar to the callosotomy, endoscopic hemispherotomy employs minimally invasive approaches, leading to smaller incisions, reduced pain, and quicker recovery times than traditional open surgeries. * **Enhanced Quality of Life:** Successfully reducing seizures through hemispherotomy can substantially

This can include increased independence, improved cognitive abilities, and better social interactions. * **Shorter Hospitalization:** The procedure's minimally invasive nature often results in shorter hospital stays, allowing patients to resume normal routine sooner. * **Potential Cognitive Gains:** By isolating the hemisphere causing seizures, the risk of cognitive decline due to ongoing seizures is minimized, potentially leading to cognitive improvements over time. ## What Are the Potential Risks and Complications Associated With Endoscopic Corpus Callosotomy and Endoscopic Hemispherotomy Surgeries? The potential risks and complications associated with endoscopic corpus callosotomy and endoscopic hemispherotomy surgeries: **Endoscopic Corpus Callosotomy:** * **Infection:** As with all surgeries, there is a possibility of infection at the surgical site or within the brain. * **Bleeding:** Additionally, there is a risk of bleeding during or after the procedure, potentially necessitating further medical attention. * **Neurological Deficits:** The surgery might result in sensory or motor deficits due to damage to adjacent brain structures. * **Cerebrospinal Fluid Leakage:** The protective fluid around the brain might leak, leading to complications. * **Changes in Cognition or Behavior:** There could be changes in cognitive function or behavior due to the impact on brain connectivity. * **Seizure Recurrence:** While

The success rates of endoscopic corpus callosotomy and hemispherotomy surgeries vary due to factors like epilepsy type, procedure specifics, patient health, and individual response. Generally, these procedures offer promising results in lessening seizure frequency and intensity, especially for severe, medication-resistant cases. Success rates range between 50 to 90 percent, considering seizure reduction and enhanced quality of life rather than complete seizure freedom. **Conclusion:** Endoscopic corpus callosotomy and endoscopic hemispherotomy represent cutting- edge surgical solutions for individuals with severe epilepsy. These minimally invasive techniques promise to enhance seizure control and overall quality of life. However, deciding on these surgeries necessitates comprehensive evaluation and consultations with medical experts to weigh potential benefits against inherent risks. </content> </article> <article> <slug>wada-test</slug> <content>**Introduction** The Wada test is a diagnostic tool that allows physicians to determine the relative relevance of language and memory processes on each cerebral side.

to determine the relative relevance of language and memory processes on each cerebral side. The epilepsy team uses the Wada test results to decide which strategy can prevent seizures while protecting brain regions related to memory and speech. Certain epilepsy and seizure disorders are caused by anomalies in brain tissue, such as tumors, scars, or other lesions, which appear as changes in blood vessels during angiography. Many of these disorders can be treated with epilepsy surgery. A pre-surgical workup for patients with seizures that are likely to require surgical intervention includes this two-part assessment to determine the potential consequences of surgery on memory and language abilities. ## What Is Epilepsy? Epilepsy is a chronic (long-term) illness marked by repeated seizures caused by abnormal electrical impulses generated by damaged neurons in the brain. An eruption of uncontrolled electrical activity in brain cells causes seizures. Seizures are changes in awareness, muscle control (jerking or twitching), sensations, emotions, or behavior. Epilepsy is capable of developing in individuals of any age, race, or gender. ## What Occurs in the Brain During an Epileptic Episode? Brain cells communicate with and receive signals from many organs in the body. The messages are transmitted via a continuous electrical impulse that travels from one cell to the next. Epilepsy interrupts the normal electrical impulse pattern. Instead, irregular bursts of electrical energy occur between cells in one or more brain areas, comparable to an unpredictable lightning storm. This electrical disruption causes changes in consciousness (including loss of consciousness), sensations,

electrical impulse that travels from one cell to the next. Epilepsy interrupts the normal electrical impulse pattern. Instead, irregular bursts of electrical energy occur between cells in one or more brain areas, comparable to an unpredictable lightning storm. This electrical disruption causes changes in consciousness (including loss of consciousness), sensations, emotions, and muscular activities. ## Is Applying the Wada Test Safe? In general, a Wada test is a low-risk technique. There is a chance of general dangers like discomfort, bleeding, or infection at the catheter insertion site. The Wada test carries a slight risk of certain problems. These side effects might range in severity from a small soreness at the site of the catheter insertion to a potentially fatal stroke. Given that the Wada requires entering arteries, there's a possibility that fat inside an artery could come loose, obstructing the flow of blood to the brain and resulting in a stroke. Overall, stroke risk is less than one percent. If patients have a history of excessive cholesterol or atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) or are older, the amount is higher (but still quite low). ## Does Wada Pose a Risk to Health? Low-risk and risk-free is the Wada test. When the anesthetic wears off, the catheter insertion site will likely experience discomfort if they experience a side effect. ## Do Any Hazards or Adverse Reactions Arise? Uncommon complications consist of: * Seizure- The chance of having a stroke is less than one percent. * The sickness is called encephalopathy. *

Uncommon complications consist of: * Seizure- The chance of having a stroke is less than one percent. * The sickness is called encephalopathy. * A stroke would happen. * Since Wada testing is an invasive process, there is a small chance of getting an infection or bleeding. The rise is only slightly bigger in older people who have atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) or have had high cholesterol before. ## What Are the Implications of the Tests Result? Using the Wada test, the treatment team will ascertain which cerebral region is predominant in language processing and which is predominant in memory. A comparison will be made between the obtained information and results from prior diagnostic procedures to ascertain the precise anatomical site of the seizures occurring within the brain. Upon obtaining all pertinent information, the surgeon can determine whether or not the brain surgery poses a risk to memory and communication abilities. ## How Is the Wada Procedure Performed? An anesthetic medicine will be administered through a catheter into either the left or right carotid artery by the neuroradiologist to induce half of the brain to sleep. Medication entering the right carotid artery can disrupt communication between the right side of the brain and the left side of the body. Experiencing those symptoms may include seeing stars, feeling pressure behind the eye, and warmth

Medication entering the right carotid artery can disrupt communication between the right side of the brain and the left side of the body. Experiencing those symptoms may include seeing stars, feeling pressure behind the eye, and warmth in the face. They will temporarily experience paralysis on one side of the body. The healthcare specialists will verify the state of the brain's activity by examining the EEG recordings. * The epileptologist will assess the speech after confirming that one brain hemisphere is inactive. * Patients may experience speech difficulties and weakness. This is typical. They may also drift off to sleep. * Children may be nonverbal during the test. Children under ten years old, those with seizures originating from the dominant side of the brain, or individuals with an IQ below 70 are more likely to face difficulties with the test. Healthcare providers will assist children in managing any fear or anxiety. * The anesthetic will dissipate within a few minutes, allowing the dormant part of the brain to become active again. Subsequently, the epileptologist will inquire about the recollection. * Eventually, the professionals treating the patient will anesthetize the other hemisphere of the brain. The catheter will be retracted and carefully advanced into the second internal carotid artery. Another angiography will be performed. ## What Occurs Following the Recovery? After the examination, the patient will continue to recuperate in the recuperation unit. The healthcare provider will conduct

Another angiography will be performed. ## What Occurs Following the Recovery? After the examination, the patient will continue to recuperate in the recuperation unit. The healthcare provider will conduct periodic pulse checks at the location of catheter insertion in the leg. Additionally, the bandages that are obstructing the incision in the genitals will be scrutinized to verify the complete restoration of tactile sensation. These procedures are executed to guarantee adequate circulation in the affected leg. **Conclusion** Wada test findings significantly increase the ability to anticipate changes in language learning and memory performance after surgery. The Wada test is crucial in preoperatively evaluating specific patients with established clinical indications. It helps assess the risks and advantages of epilepsy surgery at an individual level. Adapting outcome measures and selecting appropriate stimulus material for memory testing during the WT can enhance the assessment of material-specific HML and improve the predictive value of WT results for postsurgical cognitive impairment in clinical practice and future research. </content> </article> <article> <slug>contraception-for-women-with-epilepsy</slug> <content>**Introduction:** Regarding contraception or birth control for women with epilepsy, it is pivotal to consider the possible interactions between the epileptic medications they take and the contraceptives they are about to take.

consider the possible interactions between the epileptic medications they take and the contraceptives they are about to take. Certain epilepsy medicines could affect the efficacy of contraceptives, particularly hormonal contraceptives like birth control patches, pills, and rings. Moreover, certain hormonal contraceptives, like pills, could interfere with the efficacy of their medications. It is essential to pick the right contraceptive method for epilepsy. ## What Are the Potential Interactions Between Contraceptives and Epilepsy Medicine? Antiepileptic medications can interact with the effectiveness of contraception provided by hormonal contraceptives. Not all antiepileptic drugs interact, but some could interact and reduce efficacy. * One group of drugs called liver enzyme-inducing drugs could interact with hormonal contraceptives. These drugs increase the rate at which the liver breaks down the contraceptive hormones in administered birth control. These drugs include Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, and Topiramate. * The other two antiepileptic drugs could increase hormone levels in the system. This includes Sodium Valproate and Felbamate. **Lamotrigine and Contraception:** Lamotrigine is the drug most affected by hormonal contraceptives in women with epilepsy. The studies show that oral hormonal contraceptive pills affect the amount of Lamotrigine that stays in the blood. So, hormonal contraception interferes with the concentration of Lamotrigine in women who are taking it for epilepsy treatment. ## What Are the Contraceptives Affected by Anti-epileptic Drugs? Epilepsy medications can interfere with hormonal contraceptives, and hormonal contraceptives, in turn, affect the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs like Lamotrigine. So, certain antiepileptic medications can make several hormonal contraceptives less reliable and

in women who are taking it for epilepsy treatment. ## What Are the Contraceptives Affected by Anti-epileptic Drugs? Epilepsy medications can interfere with hormonal contraceptives, and hormonal contraceptives, in turn, affect the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs like Lamotrigine. So, certain antiepileptic medications can make several hormonal contraceptives less reliable and effective, increasing the risk of unplanned pregnancy. The common hormonal contraceptives that can be affected by epilepsy medications include the following. * **Combined Oral Contraceptive Pills:**Combined oral contraceptive pills are generally known as pills that contain both progesterone and estrogen hormones. This helps prevent the ovaries from producing or releasing eggs every month. Not all antiepileptic medications are effective, but certain antiepileptic drugs make the pills less efficient. So, the doctors usually recommend taking the pill at a higher dosage or using an alternative birth control aid. * **Emergency Contraceptive Pills:** The emergency contraceptive pill is generally called the morning pill. This form is emergency contraception because this pill can be taken within 72 hours following sexual intercourse. The clinical reports say that some antiepileptic drugs can affect the efficacy of these morning pills. So, discussing the antiepileptic drugs one takes with the healthcare provider if accessing this form of a pill is essential. * **Progesterone-Only Pill:** This is also known as a mini pill. The progesterone-only pill contains the only hormone, progesterone. This is regarded as less effective contraception when compared to the combined pills. The progesterone-only pill is generally not recommended for women on antiepileptic medications. * **Vaginal

a pill is essential. * **Progesterone-Only Pill:** This is also known as a mini pill. The progesterone-only pill contains the only hormone, progesterone. This is regarded as less effective contraception when compared to the combined pills. The progesterone-only pill is generally not recommended for women on antiepileptic medications. * **Vaginal Ring:** The vaginal ring is a small, flexible plastic ring to be placed inside the vagina. This contraceptive releases a continuous dosage of both the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Similar to combining contraceptive pills, the vaginal ring prevents an egg's release from the ovaries every month. This also seems to be less effective for women taking certain epilepsy medications. * **Contraceptive Implant:** The contraceptive implant is typically an implantable medical contraceptive device used effectively for birth control. This implant works according to the timely release of hormones, hindering ovulation in women. The significant hormone this contraception constitutes is progesterone. The efficacy of this contraceptive method can be significantly affected by certain antiepileptic drugs. * **Natural Contraception:** Natural contraception is sometimes referred to as a rhythm method. Natural contraception is practiced when the individual works at a particular time of the menstrual cycle when it is safer to have sex. The hormonal changes in the body can largely influence this natural contraception. ## What Are the Recommended Contraceptives for Women With Epilepsy? The studies show that antiepileptic drugs primarily affect hormonal contraceptive methods, not non-hormonal birth control methods. The contraception methods that do not interfere with epilepsy medications include the following.

hormonal changes in the body can largely influence this natural contraception. ## What Are the Recommended Contraceptives for Women With Epilepsy? The studies show that antiepileptic drugs primarily affect hormonal contraceptive methods, not non-hormonal birth control methods. The contraception methods that do not interfere with epilepsy medications include the following. * **Condoms:**Condoms are a barrier device that reduces the probability of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections(STIs). This is a non-hormonal method that has nothing to do with the hormones in women. So, this can be used by women with epilepsy. * **Contraceptive Injections:** The contraceptive injection helps prevent pregnancy. The synthetic progesterone hormone (Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) is injected into the woman. This works by preventing the body from making its hormones. This also prevents the release of eggs from the ovaries every month. So, women with epilepsy can have Contraceptive injections often, even every ten weeks. * **Diaphragms:** The diaphragm, known as caps, is a non-hormonal barrier method. It fits inside the vagina, preventing the entry of sperm into the cervix (the access region of the womb). So this prevents pregnancy by creating a barrier between the sperm of the man and the uterus of the woman. This can be implemented for women with epilepsy. * **Intrauterine Devices:** An intrauterine device is a form of contraception where the healthcare professional inserts it into the uterus by means of a procedure. It is shaped like a â€˜Tâ€™ to fit well-fit inside the vagina. This is effective in preventing unplanned pregnancies. This

It is shaped like a â€˜Tâ€™ to fit well-fit inside the vagina. This is effective in preventing unplanned pregnancies. This approach is helpful for women with epilepsy without affecting the efficacy of their medications. **Conclusion:** The medications for epilepsy can interfere with the hormonal contraceptives they use, and vice versa. So, It is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional who could help provide tailored and personalized advice according to the specific situation. The doctors consider suggesting adjunct methods, including non-hormonal aids. In contrast, doctors might recommend specific hormonal contraceptive methods that are less likely to influence antiepileptic medicines. Nevertheless, health experts say it is vital to find a balance between maintaining seizure control and effective contraception. </content> </article> <article> <slug>genetic-and-rare-epilepsy-syndromes</slug> <content>## What Is Meant by Epilepsy?

the whole body. At times the seizure episodes are accompanied by loss of consciousness and uncontrolled bowel and bladder functions. Seizure is caused due to sudden electrical activities in the brain cells, which can vary in frequency. The occurrence of one seizure will not signify epilepsy, but the occurrence of more than one episode of unprovoked seizure is called epilepsy. ## What Are the Symptoms Associated With Epilepsy? The signs and symptoms associated with epilepsy are based on the type of epilepsy that affects the person. Some common signs and symptoms are * Temporary confusion. * Staring spells. * Stiffness of muscle. * Uncontrolled jerking movements of limbs. * Uncontrolled bladder functions. * Loss of consciousness. * Fever or anxiety. ## What Is Meant by Rare Epilepsy? Epilepsy is considered to be the fourth most common neurological condition that is diagnosed among 65 million people worldwide. Similar to cancer, epilepsy does not compress a single condition. Instead, it is a combination of various causes. The leading causes of epilepsy are: * Genetic. * Structural. * Metabolic. * Immune-related. * Infection. Epilepsy is not a rare condition, but various causes of epilepsy can be rare. When the underlying cause of this condition affects people less than 2,00,000, it is called rare epilepsy. Some of the rare epilepsies are: * SLC13A5 (Solute carrier antibody 13). * Dup15q (Duplication syndrome). * Angelman (genetic disorder with developmental delay). * Dravet syndrome (rare type of epilepsy). * CDKL5 (Cyclin dependent kinase 5). **What Are the

These types can change over time and vary greatly based on the frequency and severity. Most people diagnosed with this condition will not respond to anti-epileptic drugs. ## How Is Rare Epilepsy Diagnosed? The diagnosis of rare epilepsy is challenging. Most of these conditions are either missed or misdiagnosed. It is usually misdiagnosed as a seizure, where the anti-epileptic drug the doctor recommends does not help. However, certain tests help diagnose this condition early in life; some tests are * **Genetic Testing:** Genetic testing is a medical test that shows any alteration in the gene, chromosome, or protein. * **EEGs:** Electroencephalogram is the monitoring of the brainâ€™s activity. Even with these advanced diagnostic methods, 50 % of people diagnosed with rare epilepsy will not know the underlying cause. **How Is Rare Epilepsy Managed?** Most seizures are treated using anti-epileptic drugs, but these medications do not work in rare epilepsies. Alternative treatment methods for this condition include changes in diet, surgery, and devices. In the case of rare epilepsies, new precision therapies are used, where the personâ€™s genetic information is used to customize treatment for

seizures are treated using anti-epileptic drugs, but these medications do not work in rare epilepsies. Alternative treatment methods for this condition include changes in diet, surgery, and devices. In the case of rare epilepsies, new precision therapies are used, where the personâ€™s genetic information is used to customize treatment for the patient. ## What Is Meant by Genetic Epilepsy? Genetic mutation can be an underlying cause of epilepsy. These mutations can be inherited from the parents or a new genetic mutation. Genetic changes are the underlying reason for about 75 % of epilepsies. Most people whose parents are affected by epilepsy have a higher chance of inheriting it other than those whose parents are not affected. This can occur when the person inherits an altered gene from the parent. Some epilepsies caused due to genetic conditions are * Tuberous sclerosis. * Fragile X syndrome. * Rett syndrome. * Neurofibromatosis 1. ## How to Find Out Whether Epilepsy Is Due to Genetic Causes? There are various signs and symptoms by which genetic epilepsy can be diagnosed. People have a higher chance of getting genetic epilepsy if * The person has a family history of genetic epilepsy. * The person shows signs and symptoms of epilepsy in early life with normal results of blood tests and MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging) scans. **Which Genes Are Responsible for the Occurrence of Epilepsy?** Researches show that about 84 genes are known to cause epilepsy or may cause signs and symptoms of epilepsy. In addition,

and symptoms of epilepsy in early life with normal results of blood tests and MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging) scans. **Which Genes Are Responsible for the Occurrence of Epilepsy?** Researches show that about 84 genes are known to cause epilepsy or may cause signs and symptoms of epilepsy. In addition, almost 73 genes are associated with malformation in brain development. Some of the disorders related to the CNS (central nervous system) can also result in epilepsies. ## What Is Meant by Genetic Testing? Genetic testing is one of the diagnostic methods to rule out genetic epilepsy. This procedure involves testing the gene to see for any alterations in the gene that could result in epilepsy. This test is performed by taking samples of saliva or skin biopsy. Genetic testing is performed for the following reasons: * To rule out the cause of epilepsy. * This procedure helps to find the exact cause of the condition. * This helps to find out the best form of treatment or medications to be used. * This gives detailed information regarding the outcome of the condition in the long term. * This also helps parents to know whether there are chances of giving birth to their child with epilepsy. ## What Are the Results Obtained Through Genetic Testing? * **Positive Results:** Positive results show the presence of genetic epilepsy in people affected by epilepsy. A positive result in people without epilepsy shows the person is at greater risk of genetic epilepsy. * **Negative Result:**

A positive result in people without epilepsy shows the person is at greater risk of genetic epilepsy. * **Negative Result:** A negative result in people with epilepsy shows no gene changes, and further testing needs to be done to find the underlying cause. * **Uncertain Result:** This shows a change in the gene, but it is unclear what the alteration signifies. ## What Are the Reasons That Can Cause Genetic Epilepsy? There are some reasons for the occurrence of genetic epilepsy; these are * Inheritance of a mutated gene from one or both parents results in genetic epilepsy. * A new gene alteration in a newborn child can result in this condition. * An alteration in the brain structure may be caused due to brain injury, stroke, brain tumor, or meningitis. * Some genetic condition that is responsible for the alteration of the brain structure like tuberous sclerosis. **Conclusion** The occurrence of epilepsy is known to have a genetic cause if it is inherited from the affected parents or due to a new gene mutation. Some genetic epilepsies are even caused due to environmental factors. This condition is usually diagnosed with the help of genetic testing. Rare underlying conditions bring on rare epileptic seizures. In most cases, the diagnosis of this condition is challenging. Diagnosing the underlying cause and treating

Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF) is a multisystem disorder characterized by involvement of the nervous system and muscles in particular. Typically, this disorder manifests its signs and symptoms during the period of infancy or adolescence. MERRF is distinguished by progressive rigidity (spasticity), weakness (myopathy), and muscle spasms (myoclonus). Typically, muscle cells from affected individuals exhibit an anomalous appearance when stained and examined under a microscope. The term for these atypical muscle cells is "ragged-red fibers." Epilepsy (recurrent seizures), ataxia (difficulty coordinating movements), peripheral neuropathy (sensory loss in the extremities), and dementia (gradual decline in neural function) are additional characteristics of MERRF. Additionally, optic atrophy, which is the degeneration of nerve cells responsible for transmitting visual information from the eyes to the brain, and hearing loss may develop in individuals with this condition. Acute individuals may also present with cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease characterized by short stature. Less frequently, individuals with MERRF develop subcutaneous lipomas, which are fatty tumors. ## What Are the Causes? MT-TK gene mutations account for over 80 percent of all MERRF instances and are

with this condition. Acute individuals may also present with cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease characterized by short stature. Less frequently, individuals with MERRF develop subcutaneous lipomas, which are fatty tumors. ## What Are the Causes? MT-TK gene mutations account for over 80 percent of all MERRF instances and are the most frequent cause. MT-TL1, MT-TH, and MT-TS1 gene mutations have reportedly been observed to be less commonly responsible for the symptoms and signs of MERRF. The indications and symptoms of MERRF are frequently present in individuals with abnormalities in the MT-TL1, MT-TH, or MT-TS1 genes, as well as those of other mitochondrial illnesses. In mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), there are four genes: MT-TK, MT-TL1, MT-TH, and MT-TS1. Through a process known as oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria, which are parts of cells, use oxygen to transform food energy into a form that can be utilized by cells. A minor quantity of mitochondrial DNA exists, even though most DNA is contained in chromosomes inside the nucleus. Making transfer RNAs chemically related to DNA is guided by the instructions provided by the genes linked to MERRF. Within mitochondria, these molecules aid in synthesizing complete, functional proteins from amino acids, the basic building blocks of proteins. These proteins carry out oxidative phosphorylation. The production of proteins, the utilization of oxygen, and energy production by mitochondria are all hampered by MERRF mutations. Particular organs and tissues affected by these abnormalities include the brain and muscles, which have high energy requirements. Researchers have not yet identified the

Researchers have not yet identified the precise symptoms and indicators of MERRF due to alterations in mtDNA. Mutations in other mitochondrial genes bring on a few cases of MERRF; in other cases, the ailment's exact source is unknown. ## What Is the Diagnostic Method? * **Laboratory Testing:** Lactic acid levels are typically elevated in both the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of symptomatic and asymptomatic MERRF patients. After physical activity and exercise, lactic acid levels are further elevated. The CSF protein level is also elevated but rarely exceeds 100 mg/dl. CK elevation is frequently indicative of myopathy. In addition, it is essential to rule out other treatable conditions which could mimic mitochondrial disease. Among these are autoimmune inflammatory disorders, endocrinopathies (diabetes, adrenal, thyroid, and parathyroid disorders), vitamin B12 deficiency, and collagen formation disorders. * **Imaging:** Brain scans using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) may reveal early gray matter changes, whereas white matter changes occur late in the disease. Other imaging characteristics of MERRF include cerebral atrophy, cerebellar atrophy in calcification of the dentate nucleus, and alterations in the red nucleus due to progressive neuronal loss. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can prove useful In diagnosing MERRF. It displays a significant lactic acid peak. *

Other imaging characteristics of MERRF include cerebral atrophy, cerebellar atrophy in calcification of the dentate nucleus, and alterations in the red nucleus due to progressive neuronal loss. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can prove useful In diagnosing MERRF. It displays a significant lactic acid peak. * **Evaluation of Electrophysiology:** Electroencephalogram (EEG) can indicate a sluggish background activity accompanied by generalized epileptiform discharges that may be triggered by photic stimulation. These EEG characteristics may also be observed in the progress of MELAS and other myoclonic epilepsies. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies can identify small polyphasic motor units in early recruitment, indicative of a myopathic process. Nevertheless, some patients may exhibit concomitant neuropathy. * **Muscle Tissue Biopsy** : A muscle biopsy is performed to diagnose disorders that affect muscle tissue. Following removing tissue and cells from a particular muscle, the healthcare provider will examine these specimens under a microscope. A muscle biopsy is essential for diagnosing mitochondrial disorders like MERRF. More than ninety percent of individuals with MERRF exhibit pathognomonic red fibers with frayed edges. * **Genetic Analysis** : The examination of a sample of DNA to seek for changes, sometimes known as variants, that may raise an individual's risk for disease or alter treatment reactions is referred to as genetic analysis. This phrase is used to describe the process of analyzing a DNA sample. MERRF is a condition that can be identified by genetic testing. If a mutation is discovered in a family, DNA testing may be

MERRF is a condition that can be identified by genetic testing. If a mutation is discovered in a family, DNA testing may be taken to determine which family members are in danger. ## What Are the Treatment Methods? MERRF is similar to other mitochondrial illnesses in that no specific medication is available for it, as no treatment is available for this illness. * Several different treatment drugs are tested in an attempt to slow down the decline's progression, with varying degrees of success. * In patients with MERRF, the most important aspect of treatment is the symptomatic care of any problems. Patients suffering from epilepsy or myoclonic seizures are typically prescribed antiepileptic medication. Sodium valproate is normally the treatment of choice for treating myoclonic epilepsies; however, it must be used with extreme caution for treating mitochondrial illnesses because it has the potential to trigger liver failure. * Treatment for additional complications, including rhythm problems with heart deafness, is determined by their degree of severity. * It is critical to avoid substances and medications that can potentially damage mitochondria, including alcohol and antibiotics. ## What Are the Complications? Individuals who suffer from MERRF have a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmia (malfunctioning of the electrical signals responsible for regulating the heartbeat) as well as ventricular dysfunction (impaired or abnormal functioning of the ventricles, which are

that can potentially damage mitochondria, including alcohol and antibiotics. ## What Are the Complications? Individuals who suffer from MERRF have a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmia (malfunctioning of the electrical signals responsible for regulating the heartbeat) as well as ventricular dysfunction (impaired or abnormal functioning of the ventricles, which are the lower chambers of the heart responsible for pumping blood to the rest of the body), both of which can lead to cardiac failure and unexpected death. They also have a high chance of getting a head injury that causes seizures, breathing problems, a spinal disorder, diabetes, and problems with their thyroids. **Conclusion** Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers is a hereditary condition characterized by myoclonic epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, and increasing muscle weakening. An examination of the brain would reveal intact cranial nerves, diminished deep tendon reflexes, and decreased feeling of touch, pain, and vibration. The biopsy of the muscle revealed ragged-red fibers. As a result, imaging investigations and follow-up exams are critical in individuals with myoclonic epilepsy. </content> </article> <article> <slug>neurological-disorders-in-pregnancy</slug> <content>**Introduction** The brain, spinal cord, and nerves are susceptible to neurological illnesses.

People should understand the most prevalent neurological diseases that can arise during pregnancy and the consequences that the neurological disorders can have on both the mother and the baby, which may help in management and treatment options. Women can make educated decisions and receive the care needed for a successful pregnancy and delivery if they understand the impact of neurological diseases on pregnancy. ## What Are the Common Neurological Disorders During Pregnancy? Women may be more vulnerable to some neurological problems during pregnancy, or the pre-existing conditions may worsen. Epilepsy, a disorder marked by recurring seizures, is one such condition. Pregnancy, hormonal changes, and metabolic demands can impact seizure frequency and medication efficacy. Multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system, can manifest or worsen during pregnancy. Its unpredictability and possibility of disability present difficulties for both the mother and the developing baby. Migraines are another neurological condition that might interfere with pregnancy. These intense headaches can be fatal, and the symptoms can be caused or exacerbated by hormone changes, stress, or other circumstances. Furthermore, mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression are widespread among pregnant women and might present neurologically. To maintain the well-being of the mother and the baby, these problems must be carefully managed during pregnancy. ## What Are the Effects of Neurological Disorders on Pregnancy?

A range of neurological diseases can have an impact on pregnancy, including increased risks and outcomes. Pregnant women with epilepsy may be predisposed to preeclampsia, a disorder characterized by high blood pressure and organ damage. This can result in premature births as well as other issues. Multiple sclerosis increases the likelihood of preterm labor and low birth weight. Pregnancy migraines have been linked to an increased risk of gestational hypertension and preterm birth. Additionally, neurological abnormalities might impact the baby's development and health. Maternal convulsions, for example, might deprive the infant of oxygen, resulting in developmental delays or neurological disabilities. Medication used to treat neurological diseases may also endanger the growing fetus. To reduce these risks, healthcare providers must regularly monitor both the mother and the baby throughout pregnancy. ## What Are the Risks and Complications for Both the Mother and Baby? Pregnancy with a neurological condition comes with dangers and challenges for both the mother and the child. These may involve a higher possibility of pregnancy-related diabetes, urinary tract infections, and anemia in the mother. There may also be an increased risk of postpartum depression and breastfeeding difficulties. The mother's neurological symptoms may develop during pregnancy in some situations, impairing everyday functioning and quality of life. In contrast, the baby may be at a higher risk of birth abnormalities, growth limits, and developmental delays. Premature birth is

The mother's neurological symptoms may develop during pregnancy in some situations, impairing everyday functioning and quality of life. In contrast, the baby may be at a higher risk of birth abnormalities, growth limits, and developmental delays. Premature birth is also more likely in women who suffer from neurological problems. These possible consequences highlight the significance of aggressive management and thorough monitoring throughout pregnancy. Women with neurological anomalies must work closely with a healthcare team that thrives in high-risk pregnancies to ensure the best possible outcomes for both mother and baby. ## What Are the Management and Treatment Options for Neurological Disorders During Pregnancy? A comprehensive approach is essential when treating neurological problems during pregnancy. Close coordination between neurologists, obstetricians, and other specialists is required to design a personalized treatment plan that balances the mother's demands with the baby's safety. Medication changes may be required to reduce hazards while maintaining symptom control. In some cases, alternative therapies like physical therapy or cognitive- behavioral therapy may be given to assist in reducing symptoms and improving overall well-being. Women with neurological problems require regular prenatal care and monitoring. This involves regular ultrasounds to examine the baby's growth and development, as well as blood pressure and other vital signs for the mother. Genetic counseling may also be recommended to examine the possibility of the infant inheriting a neurological condition.

Genetic counseling may also be recommended to examine the possibility of the infant inheriting a neurological condition. Healthcare providers can recognize and manage any issues early on by constantly monitoring both the mother and the infant. ## How to Prepare for Pregnancy With Neurological Disorders? If people have a neurological illness and are thinking about getting pregnant, it is critical to plan ahead of time and take the required precautions. Consult a healthcare physician about the potential hazards and any necessary changes. Before conceiving, people should consider optimizing overall health by controlling their illnesses and addressing any lifestyle factors that could interfere with pregnancy. This can involve things like keeping a healthy weight, controlling stress, and ensuring people take any necessary medications at the right doses. Building a solid support network before and during pregnancy is also critical. Seek out support groups or online forums in which individuals can connect with other pregnant women who have experienced a neurological illness. People can offer invaluable insights, advice, and emotional support during this unique journey. Remember that people are not alone in this journey; tools are available to assist people. ## What Are the Available Support and Resources for Pregnant Women With Neurological Disorders?

Myoclonic seizures are characterized by sudden, brief muscle jerks or twitches, while atonic seizures involve a loss of muscle tone, leading to a sudden collapse or "drop attack." These seizures typically occur in clusters, with multiple seizures happening quickly. ## What Are the Causes of Doose Syndrome? The cause of Doose syndrome is not fully understood, but it is believed to be a genetic disorder. 1\. **Genetic Mutations:** * Some studies have identified specific genetic mutations that may be associated with Doose syndrome. For example, mutations in the GABA-A (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor gene have been found in some cases of Doose syndrome. The GABA-A receptor is a protein that plays a key role in regulating the activity of nerve cells in the brain. Mutations in this gene may disrupt regular brain activity, leading to seizures. * Another genetic mutation linked

Mutations in this gene may disrupt regular brain activity, leading to seizures. * Another genetic mutation linked to Doose syndrome is the sodium-potassium ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase) enzyme gene. This enzyme plays a critical role in maintaining the balance of electrolytes in cells, including nerve cells in the brain. Mutations in this gene may disrupt regular brain activity and lead to seizures. 2\. **Combination of Genetic and Environmental Factors:** However, it is worth noting that not all cases of Doose syndrome can be linked to specific genetic mutations. Some research suggests that genetic and environmental factors may cause Doose syndrome. The exact mechanism of how these factors interact is still not well understood, but different cases of Doose syndrome may have different causes. 3\. **Sporadic Cases:** It is also important to note that Doose syndrome is a rare disorder, and most cases are sporadic, meaning that it does not run in families. Therefore, it is difficult to establish a clear genetic cause for all cases. ## What Are the Symptoms of Doose Syndrome?

the Symptoms of Doose Syndrome? A Doose syndrome is a rare childhood epilepsy characterized by myoclonic and atonic seizures. The symptoms of Doose syndrome can vary widely from child to child, but the most common symptoms include the following: * **Myoclonic Seizures -** Sudden, brief muscle jerks or twitches characterize myoclonic seizures. These seizures can affect any muscle group in the body but are most commonly seen in the face, arms, and legs. Sudden movements or loud noises can trigger them. * **Atonic Seizures -** Atonic seizures involve a loss of muscle tone, leading to a sudden collapse or "drop attack." Children with atonic seizures may suddenly fall to the ground without warning. Sudden movements or loud noises can trigger these seizures. * **Tonic-clonic Seizures -** Tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures) are another common symptom of Doose syndrome. These seizures are characterized by a loss of consciousness, muscle stiffening (tonic phase), and muscle jerking (clonic phase). * **Other Symptoms -** May include developmental delays, cognitive impairment, and behavioral problems. In some cases, children with Doose syndrome may also experience absence seizures (petit mal seizures), characterized by a brief loss of consciousness or staring spells. ## How to Diagnose Doose Syndrome? The diagnosis of Doose syndrome can be difficult, as it can resemble other forms of childhood epilepsy. A thorough medical evaluation, including a detailed medical history, a physical examination, and a neurological examination, is typically conducted.

A thorough medical evaluation, including a detailed medical history, a physical examination, and a neurological examination, is typically conducted. These are explained as follows- * **Medical History and Physical Examination -** During the medical evaluation, the doctor will take a detailed medical history, including information about the child's seizures, developmental milestones, and other relevant medical conditions. The doctor will also perform a physical examination to check for any signs of neurological abnormalities, such as muscle weakness or poor coordination. * **Neurological Examination -** A neurological examination will also assess the child's muscle tone, reflexes, and other neurological functions. The doctor will also ask the child and parents about the symptoms, how long they last, and how often they occur. * **EEG (Electroencephalogram) -** An EEG is usually performed to record the brain's electrical activity. This test can help identify abnormal brain activity that is characteristic of seizures. EEG can also help distinguish between different types of seizures, such as myoclonic, atonic, and tonic-clonic. * **Genetic Testing -** In some cases, a genetic test may also be performed to look for specific genetic mutations linked to Doose syndrome. Genetic testing can help confirm the diagnosis of Doose syndrome and provide important information about the child's prognosis and treatment options. ## What Is the Treatment of Doose Syndrome?

Genetic testing can help confirm the diagnosis of Doose syndrome and provide important information about the child's prognosis and treatment options. ## What Is the Treatment of Doose Syndrome? The treatment of Doose syndrome typically involves the use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to control seizures. In some cases, a combination of treatments may achieve better seizure control. These include * **Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs) -** The most commonly used AEDs for Doose syndrome include Valproic acid, Clonazepam, and Lamotrigine. The choice of AEDs will depend on the child's specific symptoms, age, and other factors. These drugs help reduce the frequency and severity of seizures but do not cure the underlying condition. In some cases, a combination of AEDs may be used to achieve better seizure control. The combination of drugs must be carefully chosen and adjusted by the physician to achieve the best outcome. * **Ketogenic Diet -** A ketogenic diet may also be recommended as adjunctive therapy for Doose syndrome. The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that effectively controls seizures in some children with epilepsy. It alters the body's metabolism, producing ketones, which can have an anti-seizure effect. * **Surgery -** Surgery may be considered a treatment option in more severe cases. However, it is essential to note that surgery is typically only considered a last resort after other treatment options have been exhausted. Surgery is typically only recommended for children who have not responded well to AEDs and have severe seizures, developmental delays,

considered a treatment option in more severe cases. However, it is essential to note that surgery is typically only considered a last resort after other treatment options have been exhausted. Surgery is typically only recommended for children who have not responded well to AEDs and have severe seizures, developmental delays, and cognitive impairment. * **Psychological and Social Support -** It is also important to note that psychological and social support is important for children with Doose syndrome and their families. Many families experience significant stress and anxiety due to the unpredictable nature of seizures and the uncertainty of the future. Families need access to support groups, counseling services, and other resources to help them cope with the challenges of living with Doose syndrome. **Conclusion:** Doose syndrome is a rare childhood epilepsy characterized by myoclonic and atonic seizures. It is believed to be a genetic disorder, but the exact cause is unknown. The diagnosis can be difficult as it can resemble other forms of childhood epilepsy. Treatment typically involves antiepileptic drugs; sometimes, a ketogenic diet or surgery may be recommended. Psychological and social support is also important for children with Doose syndrome and for their families. </content> </article> <article> <slug>photosensitive-epilepsy</slug> <content>**Introduction** Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that occurs due to abnormal electrical activity of the brain.

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that occurs due to abnormal electrical activity of the brain. It is characterized by abnormal body movements, unusual patient behavior, and a loss of awareness. Multiple etiological factors are involved in epilepsy. Photosensitive epilepsy is one form of epilepsy that is triggered by light. Different light patterns, such as flickering and interchanging lights, can cause seizures (abnormal involuntary body movements) in patients with photosensitive epilepsy. This is a rare form of epilepsy commonly seen in children and adolescents who have generalized epilepsy (abnormal movements of the entire body). Almost three percent of individuals with epilepsy suffer from this type of disease. ## What Is Photosensitive Epilepsy? Photosensitivity is extreme sensitivity towards light, and the light sources may be artificial or UV (ultraviolet) radiation from the sun. Photosensitive epilepsy is when bright flickering lights trigger seizures. Flashing and contrasting lights that disturb the eyes also cause seizures. The leading cause of photosensitive epilepsy is a photo paroxysmal response in the affected individual. ## What Is a Photoparoxysmal Response? It is an abnormal response to flickering lights seen in photosensitive individuals when recorded on an electroencephalogram. The electroencephalogram records the electrical activity of the brain. The vision of an epileptic person is stimulated with bright flickering light. A response is recorded on the electroencephalogram in spikes and waves. This abnormal electroencephalographic response may be due to hyperexcitability (exaggerated response) of the visual and motor system. ## What Are the Triggering Factors of Photosensitive Epilepsy?

This abnormal electroencephalographic response may be due to hyperexcitability (exaggerated response) of the visual and motor system. ## What Are the Triggering Factors of Photosensitive Epilepsy? The brain is a significant organ that controls all voluntary and involuntary functions of the body. It receives and sends signals from the entire body through nerves. If there is any disturbance in this signal transmission, it leads to the development of neurological disorders. Epilepsy occurs mainly due to damage to the brain. Genetics plays a vital role in photosensitive epilepsy. The common triggers of photosensitive epilepsy include - * Playing video games. * Using computers and mobile phones. * Watching television (TV). * Attending concerts that have bright focus lights. * Watching fireworks. * Watching movies in cinema theaters. ## How Common Is Photosensitive Epilepsy? Photosensitive epilepsy is relatively rare compared to other types of epilepsy. It is estimated that photosensitivity affects approximately three to five percent of people with epilepsy. Photosensitive epilepsy is more common in children and adolescents than in adults, with the majority of cases being identified in individuals under the age of 20. The condition appears to affect both males and females equally. ## Which Type of Seizures Are Seen in Photosensitive Epilepsy?

Patients who have light-induced epilepsy show three types of seizures - * Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal epilepsy). * Absence seizures. * Myoclonic seizures. 1\. **Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures (Grand Mal Epilepsy)** - This type of seizure occurs in five stages. Physical changes throughout the body characterize it - * Flexing or contraction of the body. * Extension. * Tremors or shaking. * Clonic period (contraction and relaxation of muscles). * The postictal period comprises tiredness, fatigue, headache, body ache, and problems with speech. 2\. **Myoclonic Seizures** \- These seizures are of short span and occur as jerks, including a particular muscle group. The patient experiences quick, uncontrolled muscle jerks and may show unusual clumsiness. They are commonly seen in patients with photosensitive epilepsy. 3\. **Absence Seizures** \- The patient becomes still and stares blankly when this type of seizure occurs. The patient may stop doing any physical activity and stand still. After some seconds, they may resume what they were doing. It is important to note that not all individuals with epilepsy who are exposed to visual stimuli will experience seizures. Photosensitivity is a specific sensitivity to certain visual patterns or flickering lights, and only those individuals who are photosensitive will be susceptible to seizures triggered by these stimuli. ## What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Photosensitive Epilepsy?

Physical examination is done to check the tone and strength of muscles. The doctor even checks if the patient can walk properly and for balance and coordination. * A special test called an electroencephalogram (EEG) is ordered to record abnormal electrical brain activity. * Brain imaging scans such as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and CT scan (computed tomography) can be done in cases that require examination of the brain to detect significant abnormalities (brain tumors). ## What Is the Treatment for Photosensitive Epilepsy?

Avoiding places with high-intensity lights, such as concerts, nightclubs, and movie theaters. Using protective eye gear when going out in the sun. Installing dim lights in the house. * **Modifying the Use of Light-Emitting Devices** \- Watch television from a sufficient distance and use a remote control to change the channels. Reduce the brightness of the mobile phone or refrain from using it in the dark. * **Antiepileptic Drugs** \- Patients with photosensitive epilepsy may require to take minimum dosage medications life-long. Failing to do so will cause the recurrence of seizures even in patients who have been free of attacks for a long time. Patients respond well to treatment with antiepileptic drugs and lead healthy lives. * **Adequate Rest** \- Patients with epilepsy require plenty of sleep and rest. Any significant physical activities that can cause undue stress on the body should be avoided. * **Avoid Intoxicants** \- Abstain from smoking and consumption of alcohol. **Conclusion** Patients usually respond well to antiepileptic medications. Changes in lifestyle and adopting methods to avoid triggering factors lead to a good prognosis. The appearance of seizures gradually reduces as the patient grows old.

cause problems in young children and their developing brains. The infants will have mild to moderate spasms that they are sometimes unable to control. A few children complain of these episodes of spasm in their later stages of life. These infantile spasms are mild seizures where the child shows jerky and tense movements, which may be a matter of concern in later stages of life. West syndrome is used to describe when the baby has infantile spasms. ## What Are the Signs of Infantile Spasms? The infantile spasms last a few minutes, but the gap between the episodes is significantly less. The child may have continuous series of attacks. After that, there will be a cluster of single spasms. The child may have a five to ten seconds gap between the gap of episodes. All the symptoms start below the age of 12. Studies proved that 90 percentage of spasm attacks are in infants below 12 months of age occurring the spasms. The sudden stiffness in the body can be noticed, the back may arch, and the hands, legs, and back may bend forward. In some children, the eyes may roll up, and a little tummy crunch is also seen. All these are mostly seen soon after the baby wakes up from sleep. When the baby is having an episode of infantile spasms, the following signs are noticed such as: * A sudden loss in developmental milestones which were already developed, for example, the baby who was able to roll

All these are mostly seen soon after the baby wakes up from sleep. When the baby is having an episode of infantile spasms, the following signs are noticed such as: * A sudden loss in developmental milestones which were already developed, for example, the baby who was able to roll over, sit and crawl will suddenly stop performing all these activities. * Sudden loss of social interaction and smiles very rarely. * The baby may be cranky most of the time and silent. * Stops playing, loss of eye contacting, and responding to parents also becomes less. * Belly tensing is observed. * Chin movements. * Head nodding. ## What Are the Causes of Infantile Spasms? The exact cause of infantile spasms is not known. However, it is believed that infantile spasms are caused by the way the baby's brain grows in the mother's womb, infections causing brain damage or any atypical abnormalities of blood vessels in the brain, and all of these generate unique wavy patterns in the brain, resulting in infantile spasms. In a few children, infantile spasms are caused by metabolic and genetic mutations. In some children, the infantile spasms are caused by a vitamin B6 deficiency. Possible causes of Infantile spasms are: * **Brain Injuries or Infections:** Any damage to the brain increases the risk of infantile spasms. The most common cause is hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, where the brain does not get the required amount of oxygen for a short time, meningitis, and perinatal stroke (the stroke

The most common cause is hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, where the brain does not get the required amount of oxygen for a short time, meningitis, and perinatal stroke (the stroke that happens at any time of pregnancy in the first trimester of life). * **Abnormal Brain Development:** Various malformations may occur in the central nervous system development when the baby is growing in the womb. These malformations in the developing brain may cause infantile spasms. The malformations include focal cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly, holoprosencephaly, and aicardi syndrome. In addition, abnormal development of the blood vessels that supply the brain can also cause infantile spasms. * **Genetic Changes:** Scientists are linking genetic mutations and infantile spasms. For example, some genetic mutations that cause infantile spasms are trisomy 21(Down syndrome) and tuberous sclerosis. * **Metabolic Changes:** The metabolic changes, such as inborn errors of metabolism, can cause infantile spasms. The genetic modifications block the metabolic process involved in the breakdown of nutrients, which helps generate energy. It is believed that in rare cases, the infantile spasms are caused by vitamin B6 deficiency. ## How to Diagnose Infantile Spasms?

Then, the healthcare provider will ask about the baby's sudden behavioral and developmental changes. Finally, he may suggest taking the child to a neurologist or pediatric epileptologist, blood tests, and urine tests (to look for infections or illnesses). * Routine blood and urine tests are done. * EEG (electric encephalogram) is done to know the brain waves and electrical activity in the brain. A unique pattern called hypsarrhythmia generally confirms the diagnosis of infantile spasms in children. * CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan to examine the changes or abnormalities in the brain. ## How to Treat Infantile Spasms? The main goals of treatment for infantile spasms are to cease or regulate the spasms and, if feasible, to treat the etiology. The following are the primary therapy for stopping and/or managing spasms: * **Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH):** ACTH is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that influences how the body reacts to stress. The production of ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to create cortisol, also known as the "stress hormone." ACTH is a synthetic (man-made) variant of the hormone that is given as a shot (injection) to alleviate spasms. The first doses will be given to the kid in the hospital so that their healthcare professional can closely monitor them for any negative effects. Because the child will

"stress hormone." ACTH is a synthetic (man-made) variant of the hormone that is given as a shot (injection) to alleviate spasms. The first doses will be given to the kid in the hospital so that their healthcare professional can closely monitor them for any negative effects. Because the child will require ACTH shots for the next six weeks, their healthcare professional will advise parents on how to administer the injections at home. * **Prednisolone (Oral):** This drug is a man-made version of a corticosteroid hormone produced by the adrenal gland. It is effective for treating infantile spasms and can be administered when ACTH is unavailable. * **Vigabatrin:** This drug is used to treat seizures. It is taken orally as a tablet or drink. If your child does not respond to hormone therapies or Vigabatrin, other possibilities for treatment include: * The ketogenic diet is a low-carbohydrate diet. * Another seizure medication. * When there is a focalized lesion causing the infantile spasms, epilepsy surgery is performed. **Conclusion:** Infantile spasms are thought to be caused by how the baby's brain formed in the womb. Brain damage is caused by infections. The treatment seeks to minimize the severity or frequency of attacks while also treating the underlying cause of the problem if possible. It is best to seek medical attention if any of the symptoms are observed. </content> </article> <article> <slug>understanding-epilepsy-diagnosis</slug> <content>**Introduction:** Epilepsy could be described as neurological conditions that feature recurrent, unprovoked seizures, which is a global health concern.

Epilepsy, in particular, is diagnosed not easily, and it involves a clinical examination, brain imaging, and, at times, blood tests. Neuropsychology is also used in determining the cognitive and emotional effects of epilepsy on patients. Consequently, this article traces the various approaches that are applied in diagnosing epilepsy: blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), and neuropsychological tests. ## What Is Epilepsy and How Is It Diagnosed? Epilepsy is not a single disease but a range of diseases that are characterized by seizures. These are due to aberrant electrical activity in the brain and may materialize in different ways, such as convulsions, loss of consciousness, and sensations. To diagnose epilepsy, the following steps must be taken: exclusion of the other causes of seizures, identification of specific types of epilepsy, and knowledge of the etiology. A comprehensive diagnosis of epilepsy typically involves * **Clinical Assessment:** Anamnestic data, previous illness, and neurological assessment of the patient. * **Blood Tests:** To rule out underlying metabolic, infectious, or even genetic causes of the patientâ€™s symptoms. * **Neuroimaging:** Techniques that include MRI, SPECT, and PET scans to study the structure and process of the brain. * **Neuropsychology:** Identifying

Assessment:** Anamnestic data, previous illness, and neurological assessment of the patient. * **Blood Tests:** To rule out underlying metabolic, infectious, or even genetic causes of the patientâ€™s symptoms. * **Neuroimaging:** Techniques that include MRI, SPECT, and PET scans to study the structure and process of the brain. * **Neuropsychology:** Identifying the cognitively and emotionally mediated sequelae for determining specific approaches. ## How Are Blood Tests Used in Epilepsy Diagnosis? However, blood tests that are taken cannot be used to diagnose epilepsy, but they are instrumental in pointing out possible causes or predisposing factors. Other investigations, such as blood tests, can provide clues of metabolic disturbance or infections that may cause epilepsy or genetic diseases the child may be suffering from. For instance: * **Electrolyte Imbalances:** Anticonvulsant symptoms include pathologic sodium, calcium, or magnesium concentration. * **Infections:** Another examination that can be carried out is a blood test, as it can reveal infections such as meningitis or encephalitis that cause seizures. * **Genetic Testing:** Some forms of epilepsy are categorized based on genetics, and blood tests can detect different genes. * **Metabolic Disorders:** Such illnesses as hypoglycemia (a condition characterized by abnormally low blood sugar levels) or liver disease may also lead to the development of seizures, and a blood exam will be useful to diagnose these conditions. ## What Role Does Neuroimaging Play in Epilepsy Diagnosis? Neuroimaging methods play a paramount importance in the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. These methods give clear images of the brain to determine whether

lead to the development of seizures, and a blood exam will be useful to diagnose these conditions. ## What Role Does Neuroimaging Play in Epilepsy Diagnosis? Neuroimaging methods play a paramount importance in the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. These methods give clear images of the brain to determine whether the seizures are due to structural abnormality, tumor, or lesion. The most commonly used neuroimaging techniques include: * **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):** MRI was found to be effective in diagnosing epilepsy and has been defined as the gold standard in such a diagnosis. It gives a good magnification of the brain structures, and clinicians can identify features such as cortical dysplasia, hippocampal sclerosis, or tumors. MRI appears useful in other contexts where it is helpful to detect lesions that are not apparent with other imaging techniques. Additional techniques in MRI can also be employed to identify areas in the brain that are involved in seizing, such as functional MRI or fMRI. * **Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT):** SPECT is a nuclear imaging technique that analyzes brain blood flow. In a seizure, the cerebral blood flow rises in the particular brain regions, and SPECT can detect this hyperperfusion and thereby identify the seizure origin. Hybrid interictal SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) scans done before a seizure and ictal SPECT scans that are done during a seizure commonly differ in identifying the seizure onset zone. * **Positron Emission Tomography (PET):** PET is another technique of nuclear imaging that assesses brain

identify the seizure origin. Hybrid interictal SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) scans done before a seizure and ictal SPECT scans that are done during a seizure commonly differ in identifying the seizure onset zone. * **Positron Emission Tomography (PET):** PET is another technique of nuclear imaging that assesses brain metabolic rate. In epilepsy, the seizure focus exhibits a lower metabolic rate between the seizures, whereas, between seizures, the healthy state sampled from the nondominant hemisphere exhibits the rates of glucose metabolism. As has been discussed, it may be useful for PET to indicate a part of the brain that does not work properly and may cause seizures. MRI, together with PET scans, are usually applied to enhance the resolution of epilepsy diagnosis. ## Why Is Neuropsychology Important in Epilepsy Diagnosis? Neuropsychology is a sub-discipline of psychology with specific focuses that seem to be very influential in explaining the impact of epilepsy on cognition and emotions. Subjects with epilepsy have neuropsychological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, impaired memory, attention, and disordered executive function. Again, these can be measured and put into numerical figures, and the results can be useful in overall patient management. * **Cognitive Assessments****:** Neuropsychological tests help measure certain aspects of cognition, general knowledge of facts, certain memory skills, fluency, attention, language, and the ability to solve problems. The condition can also be tested together with epilepsy and its relation to specific cognitive impairments such as AEDs (Antiepileptic Drugs). * **Emotional Assessments:** Social interaction is also another

measure certain aspects of cognition, general knowledge of facts, certain memory skills, fluency, attention, language, and the ability to solve problems. The condition can also be tested together with epilepsy and its relation to specific cognitive impairments such as AEDs (Antiepileptic Drugs). * **Emotional Assessments:** Social interaction is also another important aspect, as epilepsy causes anxiety and depression, and thus, the overall quality of a human life decreases. These problems would be the subject of neuropsychological assessments with subsequent psychological treatments. * **Pre-Surgical Evaluations:** Neuropsychological assessments are quite important in patients contemplating epilepsy surgery. They contribute to assessing the possible impact of surgical operations on the patientâ€™s cognition and defining areas of the brain that should be spared in a particular operation. **Conclusion** It is evident that epilepsy diagnosis is not straightforward and involves clinic and laboratory examination, neuroimaging as well as neuropsychology. Blood tests help determine possible causes or risk factors, while MRI, SPECT, or PET scans give clearer pictures of the brain, thereby aiding the localization of seizure onset. Neuropsychology is closely involved with studying the effects of epilepsy on a patientâ€™s cognition and emotions that inform the therapy process and ensure that the quality of life of the patient is not reduced. Recent improvement in neuroimaging and neuropsychology studies contributes to the improvement in the efficacy of the epilepsy diagnosis, but problems persist. So, further developments in these research fields are critical in making new advancements for better diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy and, therefore, for the

So, further developments in these research fields are critical in making new advancements for better diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy and, therefore, for the patientâ€™s outcomes. Blood tests, neuroimaging, and neuropsychology should be incorporated to allow clinicians to create individualized treatment plans for epilepsy because this group of diseases has neurological and psychological components. </content> </article> <article> <slug>the-role-of-surgery-in-treating-neurological-disorders</slug> <content>**Introduction** Neurological disorders, which include an extensive range of conditions affecting the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves, pose major obstacles in medicine owing to their intricate nature and significant impact on patients' lives. These conditions, which might include degenerative diseases, spinal cord injuries, brain tumors, and epilepsy, sometimes require interdisciplinary methods of therapy. Surgical intervention is a crucial method that offers significant symptom reduction or the possibility of definitive treatment. Surgery attempts to treat various pathological conditions in the context of neurological disorders. For example, brain tumors may be removed to lower intracranial pressure and stop further neurological decline. Similar to this, structural defects causing epilepsy are corrected surgically to lower seizure frequency and enhance quality of life. Spinal operations help reduce pain and increase the range of motion by releasing pressure from the spinal cord or nerve roots. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), one of the most advanced surgical procedures, has demonstrated great effectiveness in treating movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, providing patients with

quality of life. Spinal operations help reduce pain and increase the range of motion by releasing pressure from the spinal cord or nerve roots. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), one of the most advanced surgical procedures, has demonstrated great effectiveness in treating movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, providing patients with restored functional skills. The role of surgery is constantly changing with improvements in both technology and surgical techniques. Technological advancements like robotic- assisted surgery, minimally invasive methods, and precision-guided navigation systems have greatly improved the effectiveness and safety of neurosurgical treatments. These advancements decrease surgical risks, speed recovery, and enhance patient outcomes. ## What Are the Various Neurological Disorders? There are many groups into which neurological conditions can be roughly classified: * **Tumors:** Depending on their location and size, benign and malignant tumors may develop in the central and peripheral nervous systems and cause a range of neurological impairments. * **Vascular Disorders:** Problems with the blood flow to the brain can cause or result in aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and strokes. * **Epilepsy:** A neurological condition marked by frequent seizures that, in some circumstances, may not respond to treatment. * **Degenerative Diseases:** Conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease gradually compromise neurological function. * **Traumatic Injuries:** Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) can result from accidents that have a catastrophic impact on neurological function. * **Functional Disorders:** Functional disorders considerably lower quality of life, such as mobility difficulties or trigeminal neuralgia. ##

disease, and Huntington's disease gradually compromise neurological function. * **Traumatic Injuries:** Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) can result from accidents that have a catastrophic impact on neurological function. * **Functional Disorders:** Functional disorders considerably lower quality of life, such as mobility difficulties or trigeminal neuralgia. ## What Is the Role of Surgery in Treating Brain Tumors? The primary form of treatment for brain tumors is surgical excision, particularly for those that are accessible, cause severe symptoms, or are life-threatening. A common surgical technique is a craniotomy, which involves removing a part of the skull to provide access to the brain. Improvements in intraoperative monitoring, neuronavigation, and neuroimaging have made these procedures much more precise. Methods like awake craniotomy, in which the patient is awake during the operation, minimize injury to important brain parts by enabling real-time neurological function evaluation. ## What Is the Role of Surgery in Treating Vascular Disorders? Surgical techniques for treating vascular problems include excision of AVMs and clipping aneurysms, which involves inserting a metal clip at the base of aneurysms to prevent rupture. One less invasive option is endovascular procedures, which involve navigating into blood arteries to insert stents or coils to repair aneurysms or AVMs. These treatments work incredibly well to stop catastrophic bleeding and strokes. ## What Is the Role of Surgery in Treating Epilepsy? Significant relief from medication-resistant epilepsy can be obtained with surgical surgery. Reconstructive surgery can be very successful in removing the seizure-causing region of the brain.

Significant relief from medication-resistant epilepsy can be obtained with surgical surgery. Reconstructive surgery can be very successful in removing the seizure-causing region of the brain. Another approach is implanting devices that assist in regulating seizures by altering brain activity, such as the responsive neurostimulation (RNS) or vagus nerve stimulator (VNS). ## What Is the Role of Surgery in Treating Degenerative Diseases? The main purpose of surgery in the field of degenerative diseases is to treat symptoms. For example, deep brain stimulation (DBS) involves implanting electrodes in particular brain areas to control dysfunctional neuronal circuits. This method has completely changed how Parkinson's disease is treated, giving patients much better motor function and a higher quality of life. ## What Is the Role of Surgery in Treating Traumatic Injuries? The three main goals of surgical treatment for spinal cord injuries and traumatic brain injuries are decompression, stability, and repair. Intracranial pressure caused by hematomas or edema can be reduced through a craniotomy. Spinal decompression and fusion surgeries can help stabilize the spine and stop future neurological degradation in cases of spinal cord injuries. ## What Is the Role of Surgery in Treating Functional Disorders? Treatment for conditions such as trigeminal neuralgia, which is characterized by excruciating facial pain, involves microvascular decompression, in which the artery causing the compression of the trigeminal nerve is removed, and ablative operations

Treatment for conditions such as trigeminal neuralgia, which is characterized by excruciating facial pain, involves microvascular decompression, in which the artery causing the compression of the trigeminal nerve is removed, and ablative operations like thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation can offer substantial symptom improvement for movement disorders. ## What Are the Advancements in Neurosurgical Techniques? Significant technical progress has improved the accuracy, safety, and outcome of surgical procedures in neurosurgery. Among the considerable innovations are: * **Minimally Invasive Surgery:** Procedures like endoscopy and keyhole surgery minimize tissue damage, reduce the risk of infection, and accelerate healing. For example, hydrocephalus is treated through endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), which creates a new channel for the passage of cerebrospinal fluid. * **Robotic-Assisted Surgery:** By enhancing skill and precision, robotic devices enable more precise and minimally invasive operations. There is a growing trend in neurosurgery treatments to employ systems such as the da Vinci Surgical System. * **Intraoperative Imaging:** Real-time imaging methods, such as intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, provide physicians with immediate information, ensuring precise targeting and reducing damage to surrounding tissues. * **Neuronavigation:** This method uses preoperative imaging to make a precise map of the patient's brain, which helps the surgeon navigate the surgical site precisely. * **Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT):** A non-invasive technique to ablate tumors or epileptic foci using thermal energy guided by magnetic resonance imaging. **Conclusion** Surgery plays an

From eliminating life-threatening tumors to controlling faulty neural networks in degenerative conditions, procedures have a chance to change lives completely. As methods and technology continue to evolve, the range and efficacy of neurosurgical treatments will expand, clearing the way to better results and a higher standard of life for patients worldwide. The constant interaction between neurosurgeons, researchers, and policymakers will be essential in addressing the ethical, socioeconomic, and technological obstacles in this rapidly evolving field, ensuring that the advantages of surgical advancements are accessible to all who need them. </content> </article> <article> <slug>epilepsy-aphasia-spectrum</slug> <content>**Introduction** The epilepsy-aphasia spectrum is a condition that has a fascinating combination of two complex neurological conditions, highlighting the relationship between epilepsy and aphasia. The main characteristic feature of these conditions is a language impairment called aphasia. This condition can affect an individual's speaking, reading, and writing skills. Another main feature of epilepsy-aphasia spectrum disorders is a certain abnormal pattern of electrical activity occurring in the brain. Due to this abnormal pattern of electrical activity, many individuals with this disorder develop recurrent seizures called epilepsy. The abnormal

This condition can affect an individual's speaking, reading, and writing skills. Another main feature of epilepsy-aphasia spectrum disorders is a certain abnormal pattern of electrical activity occurring in the brain. Due to this abnormal pattern of electrical activity, many individuals with this disorder develop recurrent seizures called epilepsy. The abnormal pattern of electrical activity occurring in the brain can be detected with the help of electroencephalogram (EEG). ## What Is Epilepsy? Epilepsy is a neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures. Seizure episodes are caused by extreme electrical discharges in a set of brain cells. Seizures can vary from muscle jerks or short lapses of attention to severe and long-lasting convulsions (uncontrolled body shaking due to sudden muscle contraction and relaxation). There are various types of epilepsy. The exact cause can be identified in a few people, but the cause may have yet to be discovered. The frequency of epilepsy can vary from less than once per year to multiple times per day. ## What Is Aphasia? Aphasia is a neurological disorder that occurs due to damage in the region of the brain that is responsible for language skills such as speaking or understanding what other people say. There are various types of aphasia. The location of damage in the brain determines the aphasia type. For most individuals, these areas on the left side of the brain are damaged. This condition generally occurs as a symptom of another problem, such as a head injury, brain tumor, stroke, or other neurological disorders.

types of aphasia. The location of damage in the brain determines the aphasia type. For most individuals, these areas on the left side of the brain are damaged. This condition generally occurs as a symptom of another problem, such as a head injury, brain tumor, stroke, or other neurological disorders. Aphasia can be cured, especially when the underlying condition can be managed or healed independently. ## What Are the Conditions Associated With the Epilepsy-Aphasia Spectrum? Epilepsy and aphasia are two separate entities, but in some conditions or syndromes both of these conditions overlap, which include Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), autosomal dominant rolandic epilepsy with speech dyspraxia (ADRESD), epileptic encephalopathy with continuous spike-and-wave during sleep syndrome (ECSWS), intermediate epilepsy-aphasia disorder (IEAD), childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (CECTS), and atypical childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (ACECTS). Most of these conditions develop in early childhood. **Landau-Kleffner Syndrome** \- It is a severe form of the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum. Its main feature is the sudden or gradual onset of language regression and the characteristic abnormal brain electrical activity patterns. This condition occurs during early childhood. Children with this condition will have a decline in language skills, including difficulties with expression, comprehension, and disorders of the hearing system. Generally, the children start speaking in early childhood, but they will lose language skills at the age of five. The initial sign of aphasia begins with a selective inability to recognize sounds, called verbal agnosia. As the condition develops, the ability to talk is also impaired. About 70 percent

system. Generally, the children start speaking in early childhood, but they will lose language skills at the age of five. The initial sign of aphasia begins with a selective inability to recognize sounds, called verbal agnosia. As the condition develops, the ability to talk is also impaired. About 70 percent of children with this condition also experience seizure activity, especially during sleep, specifically during deep sleep. It is a partial type of seizure because the seizure activity occurs only in certain regions of the brain rather than affecting the entire part of the brain. **Epileptic Encephalopathy With Continuous Spike-And-Wave During Sleep Syndrome (ECSWS)** \- It is also a severe form of the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum. Children with this condition mostly develop normally in early childhood, while some may have developmental speech and motor skills delays. When this condition develops, the children with ECSWS lose some previously acquired skills, such as learning, language, behavior, or movement. Around 80 percent of children with ECSWS develop seizures. Seizures can be of various types, such as hemiclonic seizures, which cause involuntary jerking of one side of the body; atypical absence seizures, which are unusual short-time seizures of staring blankly; or generalized tonic-clonic seizures, which cause severe stiffness of muscles with rhythmic jerking of the entire body. **Childhood Epilepsy With Centrotemporal Spikes (CECTS)** \- It is a mild form of epilepsy-aphasia spectrum. Most children affected by this condition have normal development. However, some may face difficulty coordinating the mouth and tongue movements required for clear speech.

severe stiffness of muscles with rhythmic jerking of the entire body. **Childhood Epilepsy With Centrotemporal Spikes (CECTS)** \- It is a mild form of epilepsy-aphasia spectrum. Most children affected by this condition have normal development. However, some may face difficulty coordinating the mouth and tongue movements required for clear speech. Some also have impaired language skills. The affected individuals also have seizures that are triggered by abnormal activity in the rolandic region of the brain; this type of seizure is called rolandic seizures. These seizures usually occur during sleep; the signs and symptoms include drooling and impaired speech. In most individuals with this condition, the seizures disappear by the end of adolescence. **Continuous Spike-Wave in Slow-Wave Sleep (CSWS)** \- This condition is called electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep (ESES). The main feature of this condition is continuous epileptiform activity in the brain during sleep. This abnormal activity can lead to cognitive and behavioral impairments in the affected individuals. The affected individuals may face language regression, poor speaking ability, and other cognitive disturbances. Affected individuals also have seizures that originate from specific areas of the brain, characterized by alterations in consciousness and language impairments. **Intermediate Epilepsy-Aphasia Disorder (IEAD)** \- It is a mild form of the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum. Children with this condition have delayed or regressed language skills. In most children, seizures and other abnormal electrical activity in the brain occur during sleep. However, seizures are less prominent when compared to other conditions. **Atypical Childhood Epilepsy With Centrotemporal Spikes (ACECTS)**

is a mild form of the epilepsy-aphasia spectrum. Children with this condition have delayed or regressed language skills. In most children, seizures and other abnormal electrical activity in the brain occur during sleep. However, seizures are less prominent when compared to other conditions. **Atypical Childhood Epilepsy With Centrotemporal Spikes (ACECTS)** \- It is a moderate form of epilepsy-aphasia spectrum. This condition has seizures and developmental delays that can affect the affected individuals' language, movement, and attention. ACECTS individuals have focal seizures, learning disabilities, and speech difficulties due to dyspraxia. ## What Is the Treatment for the Epilepsy-Aphasia Spectrum? Management of epilepsy-aphasia spectrum disorders is a multidisciplinary approach, addressing both language abnormalities and epileptic seizures. Depending on the type of seizure, the treatment changes. To control seizures, antiepileptic medications will be prescribed. To improve language function and communication skills, speech therapy and other rehabilitative interventions will be needed. **Conclusion** The epilepsy-aphasia spectrum is a combination of epilepsy and aphasia. This condition may occur during the early childhood period. Seizure attacks can occur, depending on which part of the brain is affected. Other symptoms are speech disabilities, communication difficulties, and developmental delays. By early recognizing and understanding this spectrum, it is easy for healthcare professionals to diagnose and treat the condition. </content> </article> <article> <slug>seizure-induced-pleocytosis</slug> <content>**Introduction** A seizure is a quick and uncontrolled brain activity that results in abnormal jerky movements, limb stiffening, and loss of consciousness.

for healthcare professionals to diagnose and treat the condition. </content> </article> <article> <slug>seizure-induced-pleocytosis</slug> <content>**Introduction** A seizure is a quick and uncontrolled brain activity that results in abnormal jerky movements, limb stiffening, and loss of consciousness. Seizures are attributed to various causes, namely, stroke, brain infections (meningitis), cancer, an overdose of certain medications, and high fever. Repeated seizures are characteristic of epilepsy. Recently, COVID-19 has also been found to precipitate seizures. After a seizure episode, numerous changes have been reported to occur in the brain. One of them is seizure-induced pleocytosis. It is also called post-ictal pleocytosis. ## What Is Seizure-Induced Pleocytosis? Pleocytosis is the raised number of white blood cells (WBCs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is an uncommon finding after an epileptic attack. CSF pleocytosis is usually a result of viral or bacterial meningitis, brain cancer, or stroke. It is defined as WBCs > 10 - 12 cells/millimeter3 (mm). The white blood cells mainly raised in the CSF are polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) and lymphocytes. ## What Is the Underlying Mechanism of Seizure-Induced Pleocytosis? Seizure-induced pleocytosis is a transient phenomenon whose exact underlying mechanism is unknown. It was first described in the 1920s. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a network of blood vessels that prevents the entry of toxins and pathogens from reaching the brain. Theories state that a temporary break in the BBB occurs following a seizure noted in experimental animal models. As a result, the mediating immune cells, such as cytokines and chemokines, attract WBCs to the

network of blood vessels that prevents the entry of toxins and pathogens from reaching the brain. Theories state that a temporary break in the BBB occurs following a seizure noted in experimental animal models. As a result, the mediating immune cells, such as cytokines and chemokines, attract WBCs to the CSF. ## What Are the Cases Reported of Seizure-Induced Pleocytosis? There have been a few cases to date. 1. Prokesch et al., in 1983, stated in their data review that out of 102 enlisted epileptic patients, 35 had CSF pleocytosis. Furthermore, out of the 35, 31 had pleocytosis without any cause despite the laboratory and radiology investigations. PMNs consisted of 57 % of the raised cells in the examination. They concluded that the occurrence was transient, and the CSF became normal with the patientâ€™s rapid recovery. 2. Devinsky et al. observed post-ictal pleocytosis in 7 CSF specimens in 27 epileptic patients. The patients comprised all the categories of epilepsy. They noted that seizure-induced pleocytosis was more frequent in recent samples of CSF after a seizure. 3. Schmidley et al. reported seizures to be the primary cause of pleocytosis. In addition, six patients showed temporary and unexplained pleocytosis following repeated seizures. Meningitis, bacterial and viral infections, inflammation, bleeding, and cancer were excluded. The authors concluded that although seizures alone can cause pleocytosis, infectious causes also must be ruled out. 4. In 2014, Johnson et al. conducted a study on children aged one month to 21 years suffering from status epilepticus (SE)

Meningitis, bacterial and viral infections, inflammation, bleeding, and cancer were excluded. The authors concluded that although seizures alone can cause pleocytosis, infectious causes also must be ruled out. 4. In 2014, Johnson et al. conducted a study on children aged one month to 21 years suffering from status epilepticus (SE) without Central Nervous System (CNS) infection. SE is a state with repeated seizures with loss of consciousness within 30 minutes. Hence, it is a state of emergency. Out of the 178 children, seven had CSF pleocytosis. Further, viral studies on these patients deduced Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection in six children with CSF pleocytosis. Therefore, the authors concluded that an infection causing pleocytosis in children should be considered, as seizure-induced pleocytosis is rare. 5. Schachter et al. reported a case of a 68-year-old female who had epilepsy in Israel in 2017. The patient had a history of schizophrenia, diabetes mellitus type II, hypothyroidism, and high cholesterol (dyslipidemia). The patient was taking medications for the same. Computed Tomography (CT) showed no acute changes, such as evidence of bleeding, benign and malignant tumors, and inflammation. They suggested a reasonable cause for CSF pleocytosis in the patient might be a psychiatric disorder. 6. Scramstad et al. conducted a similar study in 2017, revealing that seizures do not directly cause CSF pleocytosis. Alternatively, it reflects an underlying acute or chronic brain pathology. Out of the 51 patients enrolled, twelve had CSF pleocytosis. Meningitis, cocaine abuse, and alcohol withdrawal were the most probable causes. 7.

Out of the 51 patients enrolled, twelve had CSF pleocytosis. Meningitis, cocaine abuse, and alcohol withdrawal were the most probable causes. 7. A recent review in 2022 suggested that the new category of SE called new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) and fever-infection-related refractory epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) must be differentiated in children. FIRES is a sub-category of NORSE in which fever occurs about 24 hours to 2 weeks before the onset of SE. CSF pleocytosis without infection can occur in this condition. Other authors who reported a similar condition are Aminof and Simon, Edwards et al., Barry and Hauser, Peltola et al., and Tumani et al. ## What Are the Investigations To Diagnose the Condition? An elevated CSF leukocyte level hardly provides a definitive diagnosis. However, it might indicate an underlying CNS condition. The investigations done for a diagnostic workup are 1. **Lumbar Puncture** \- It is also called the spinal tap procedure. Lumbar puncture is done for CSF analysis. Elevated WBCs, elevated glucose, and protein levels are also found. 2. **Electroencephalograph** \- Electroencephalograph or EEG is a useful and specific tool for diagnosing epilepsy. It includes spikes, sharp waves, or a combination of both. 3. **Magnetic Resonance Imaging** \- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is superior to EEG for diagnosing seizure disorders. Also, MRI diagnoses any underlying brain disease. 4. **Computed Tomography** \-

Also, MRI diagnoses any underlying brain disease. 4. **Computed Tomography** \- Computed Tomography, or CT, is used to diagnose space-occupying lesions (tumors, blood vessel disorders, and infections). CT Angiography is an advancement for diagnosing blood vessel disorders of the brain. 5. **Positron Emission Tomography** \- Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an interesting imaging technique to detect any active inflammation in the brain. PET is sometimes combined with CT for better efficacy. ## What Is the Management of Seizure-Induced Pleocytosis? It is suggested that the doctors start the medication before the final diagnosis. Recurrent seizures should be managed as an emergency. Anti- epileptic drugs such as sodium valproate, carbamazepine, and oxcarbazepine are used. Adequate hydration, diet modification, surgery, and vagus nerve stimulation are advised. Before ruling out the causative agent, the medications must be aimed at all the primary causes of pleocytosis. For bacterial meningitis, antibiotics are prescribed. Viral infection can be suspected if the CSF analysis points to lymphocytic pleocytosis. Acyclovir, an anti-viral medication, is given orally or intravenously. Advanced treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and leukapheresis are advised in specific brain tumors. **Conclusion** Seizure-induced pleocytosis is an uncommon occurrence.

Advanced treatment modalities such as chemotherapy and leukapheresis are advised in specific brain tumors. **Conclusion** Seizure-induced pleocytosis is an uncommon occurrence. Only 2 % to 20 % of the previously conducted studies reveal seizure-induced CSF pleocytosis. There needs to be more supportive evidence to explain that seizures disrupt the BBB. Further, the experimental models suggest that BBB disruption leads to smaller molecules entering the brain. However, entering larger components, such as cells, is difficult. Hence, further research is required to elucidate this phenomenon. </content> </article> <article> <slug>reflex-epilepsy</slug> <content>**Introduction** Reflex epilepsies are a combination of epileptic reactions which can be caused due to external and internal stimuli. Certain factors, like flashlights, sounds, or nonverbal activities, act as triggers. This form of epilepsy can also be triggered habitually. People who suffer from pure reflex epilepsy will experience seizures in response to particular stimuli and do not suffer spontaneous seizures. ## What Is Meant by Epilepsy? Epilepsy is a brain disorder that is characterized by repeated seizures. A seizure is an abrupt change in the electrical activity of the brain, which is temporary. Usually, the brain produces continuous tiny electrical impulses in a pattern. These impulses travel through the neurons known as the network of nerve cells and throughout the whole body with the help of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. In the case of epilepsy, the pattern of the electrical activity is disturbed, causing imbalance and resulting in recurrent seizures. The sudden burst of electrical

impulses travel through the neurons known as the network of nerve cells and throughout the whole body with the help of chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. In the case of epilepsy, the pattern of the electrical activity is disturbed, causing imbalance and resulting in recurrent seizures. The sudden burst of electrical energy can affect the person's consciousness, movements, and sensations. ## What Is Meant by Reflex Epilepsy? Reflex epilepsy is a condition where a seizure occurs due to a trigger or stimuli. These stimuli can be environmental, external stimulus, or internal, which include an emotion or mental process. This form of seizure is unique; almost four to seven percent of people who suffer from seizures will display this condition. **Some Common Environmental Triggers Are:** * A sensation of touch. * Light. * Movements. * Sounds like church bells. * Music or song. * Person's voice. **Some Complex Triggers Are:** * Reading. * Writing. * Working out arithmetic. * Thinking about something specific. ## What Are the Types of Reflex Epilepsy? There are two types of reflex epilepsy; these are * **Extrinsic Reflex Epilepsy:** Which includes the external stimuli that cause reflex epilepsy; these are * **Photosensitive Epilepsy:** Certain people are very sensitive to certain frequencies of light or visual patterns, which can trigger seizures. Television and video games are common triggering factors, and about three percent of people are affected by this seizure. * **Eye Closure Sensitivity:** In this form, the person is sensitive to the closure of the eye and

sensitive to certain frequencies of light or visual patterns, which can trigger seizures. Television and video games are common triggering factors, and about three percent of people are affected by this seizure. * **Eye Closure Sensitivity:** In this form, the person is sensitive to the closure of the eye and keeps fluttering the eyelids. * **Musicogenic Epilepsy:** In this form of epilepsy, the affected person is sensitive to sounds like church bells, machinery, or songs, which can trigger seizures. * **Orofacial Reflex Myoclonia:** Some people may be sensitive to the muscle jerks around the mouth, jaw, or tongue while reading or talking. * **Praxis Induction:** Some people are sensitive to muscle jerks due to visual motor activities like playing chess and cards, writing, drawing, etc. * **Reading Epilepsy:** People experience seizures after reading when the book's content has enhanced difficulty or has more emotional content. * **Hot Water or Bathing Seizure:** In this case, the person may be sensitive to water, the temperature, quantity, and where on the body the water contacts. All these factors can trigger a seizure. * **Touch-Induced Seizure:** In this type of seizure, certain touch sensations can trigger seizure-like friction against the skin, brushing, and any stimulation in certain body parts. * **Intrinsic Reflex Epilepsy:** External factors do not cause intrinsic reflex seizures. It is caused due to increased brain functioning. Any mental process like decision-making, calculating, or reasoning can trigger seizures. In rare cases, non-verbal activity can cause seizures, commonly seen in adult males. **What

stimulation in certain body parts. * **Intrinsic Reflex Epilepsy:** External factors do not cause intrinsic reflex seizures. It is caused due to increased brain functioning. Any mental process like decision-making, calculating, or reasoning can trigger seizures. In rare cases, non-verbal activity can cause seizures, commonly seen in adult males. **What Are Other Seizure Types That Occur in Reflex Epilepsy?** Almost 85 % of seizures that are reflex epilepsy are tonic-clonic seizures. During this seizure, muscle jerks and movements throughout the body, including the arms and legs. The person experiencing such a seizure can become unresponsive and may lose consciousness. Some types of seizures that occur during reflex epilepsy are * **Absence Seizure:** This type of seizure causes a lapse in consciousness, making the person feel like daydreaming. This may also cause eye fluttering and rolling. * **Myoclonic Seizure:**Myoclonic seizure can cause muscle jerks or twitches of muscles that last only for two seconds. * **Focal Seizure:** Focal seizure originates from one brain region, which can affect other areas of the whole brain. This includes muscle contraction, visual alterations, and other symptoms based on the affected brain region. ## What Is the Cause of Reflex Epilepsy? Photosensitive seizure usually begins during childhood. It mainly occurs in children whose parents are very sensitive to flashlights. People affected by other epilepsy types, such as Dravet syndrome, caused due to alteration in sodium channels, can cause reflux epilepsy. Reflux epilepsy can occur due to mutations in LGI1 and MECP2 GENES. People affected by reflux

childhood. It mainly occurs in children whose parents are very sensitive to flashlights. People affected by other epilepsy types, such as Dravet syndrome, caused due to alteration in sodium channels, can cause reflux epilepsy. Reflux epilepsy can occur due to mutations in LGI1 and MECP2 GENES. People affected by reflux epilepsy display normal development and do not show any alterations in the nervous system during neurological examination. ## How Is Reflux Epilepsy Diagnosed? If the doctors suspect reflux epilepsy with the help of the symptoms experienced by the person, then the medical and family history of the person is collected. Some imaging tests are performed to confirm the diagnosis, such as, * **EEG:** Electroencephalogram is used very frequently where it displays normal background with general and focal irregular and abnormal activities. * **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):** Magnetic resonance imaging is sometimes recommended to view structures inside the head. * **Functional MRI:** Functional MRI is an advanced imaging technique used to view malfunctioned brain areas. ## How Is Reflux Epilepsy Managed? * An efficient way to prevent reflux epilepsy is by avoiding trigger stimuli such as flashlights that cause the seizure. * Playing video games or watching television shows can trigger seizures due to sleep deprivation, stress, and excitement caused by playing these games. Proper sleep and control of stress are better ways to avoid these triggers. These are not the causative factor if the seizure is caused post-game or television show. * People affected by reflux epilepsy are recommended medications

seizures due to sleep deprivation, stress, and excitement caused by playing these games. Proper sleep and control of stress are better ways to avoid these triggers. These are not the causative factor if the seizure is caused post-game or television show. * People affected by reflux epilepsy are recommended medications as the seizure is unavoidable or if the seizure occurs due to an unknown cause. ## What Is the Outlook of Reflux Seizure? Avoiding the triggering factor and following proper anti-seizure drugs regularly can help the person prevent the occurrence of these seizures. In some cases, the reflux epilepsy subsides as the person ages. The Epilepsy Foundation says that about 75 % of the people affected by photosensitive epilepsy will experience seizures even after the age of 25 years if they are not treated. **Conclusion** Reflux seizure is a type of seizure that is caused due to external or internal stimuli. These seizures can vary in severity depending on the trigger factor. These seizures affect the whole body. This can be treated best by avoiding the triggering factor and with the help of anti-seizure medications. </content> </article> <article> <slug>post-traumatic-epilepsy</slug> <content>**Introduction** : Post-traumatic epilepsy is an uncommon condition of recurrent seizure (abnormal electrical activity in the brain) disorder and is believed to be a traumatic brain injury.

The most common cause of mortality and morbidity, along with functional disabilities and post-traumatic epilepsies, is usually traumatic brain injury. The guideline for post-traumatic epilepsy recommends a seven-day course of prophylaxis (treatment action taken or given to prevent disease). Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are the tools used to diagnose post-traumatic epilepsy by detecting brain lesions. Antiepileptic drugs are usually used for the treatment of post-traumatic epilepsy. However, antiepileptic drugs are sometimes associated with adverse risk factors. ## What Is Epilepsy? Epilepsy is a neurological disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causes a period of unusual behavior or seizure (abnormal electrical activity in the brain), and causes loss of awareness and sensation. Epilepsy affects both females and males irrespective of age group. ## What Are the Symptoms of Epilepsy? The symptoms of epilepsy are: * Temporary confusion. * Uncontrolled movement of legs and arms. * Loss of awareness or consciousness. * Psychological symptoms such as anxiety and fear. * Stiff muscles. ## What Is Post-Traumatic Epilepsy? Post-traumatic epilepsy is a form of acquired epilepsy caused by physical damage to the brain or a recurrent seizure (abnormal electrical activity in the brain) disorder that results from brain injury. About one in fifty people with brain injury are likely to develop post-traumatic epilepsy. Developing post-traumatic epilepsy is more common in children than adults. ## What Are the Causes of Post Traumatic Epilepsy? The

Clinical Features of Post Traumatic Epilepsy? The clinical features of post-traumatic epilepsy are : * The prevalence of incidence of post-traumatic epilepsy is higher in males as compared to females. * It most commonly affects 0 to 12 years and 15 to 27. * Generalized onset seizure is the most common type of seizure. ## What Are Different Types of Post Traumatic Epilepsy? The different types of post-traumatic epilepsy are as follows: * **Immediate Post-Traumatic Epilepsy:** A seizure that occurs within 24 hours after injury to the brain is called immediate post-traumatic epilepsy. * **Early Post Traumatic Epilepsy:** Seizure that occurs within one week after injury to the brain. * **Late Post-Traumatic Epilepsy:** A seizure that occurs after more than one week is called late post-traumatic epilepsy. ## What Are the Risk Factors of Post Traumatic Epilepsy? The various risk factors associated with post-traumatic epilepsy are as follows: * Skull fracture. * History of alcohol abuse. * Severe traumatic brain injury. * Retained intracerebral fragments. * Penetrating injury. * Epidural hemorrhage (collection of blood that forms between dura mater and skull). ## How to Diagnose Post-Traumatic Epilepsy? The person should have encountered a head injury to diagnose post-traumatic injuries. The following methods are used for the diagnosis of post-traumatic epilepsy : * **Electroencephalography (EEG):** It is used to diagnose seizure disorder. It can be helpful to determine severity, localize epileptic focus, and predict the recurrence of epilepsy if the epileptic drug consumption is stopped. * **Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI):** It

It can be helpful to determine severity, localize epileptic focus, and predict the recurrence of epilepsy if the epileptic drug consumption is stopped. * **Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI):** It is performed to detect the presence of post-traumatic epilepsy. * **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan** : It is used if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not available to detect any lesion formation in the brain. ## What Is Management for Post-Traumatic Epilepsy? * Early post-traumatic epilepsy should be treated as it can proceed and damage brain activity and already compromised brain. * In case of active seizures, antiepileptic drugs such as Sodium Valproate are. They can be used with intravenous (IV) Benzodiazepine for their effectiveness. * In the case of late post-traumatic epilepsy, treatment is not necessary. However, some patients choose not to take regular medicine as compliance with long-term treatment is often very poor. * Patients with post-traumatic epilepsy should be on medication, and surgical treatment is also an option for post-traumatic epilepsy refractory to medicine. * Things to be kept in mind if the seizure has not stopped are to avoid climbing on a ladder, roof, or tree. Always accompany someone going to the swimming pool or beach. * Loosen the tight clothes of the affected person, especially around the neck region. * Make sure the person should avoid falling accidentally. * The person should be turned on the

to avoid climbing on a ladder, roof, or tree. Always accompany someone going to the swimming pool or beach. * Loosen the tight clothes of the affected person, especially around the neck region. * Make sure the person should avoid falling accidentally. * The person should be turned on the side so that anything in the mouth does not block the throat. * In some situations, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is often performed. ## What Are Lifestyle Modifications for Post-Traumatic Epileptic Patients? The various lifestyle modifications for post-traumatic epileptic patients are : * **Diet** : It is important for the treatment of refractory treatment in children. * **Sleep** : Lack of sleep can trigger an epileptic attack. Proper sleep habits should be practiced with care. * **Exercise** : It is essential to reduce the risk of post-traumatic epilepsy. * **Caffeine, Drugs, and Alcohol:** Tend to trigger a non-traumatic seizure. ## Can Emotional Trauma Trigger Epilepsy? Trauma, such as stress and depression, may increase the risk of epilepsy. Acute stress due to traumatic incidents may be the reason for epilepsy in some. One observational study that occurred in 2021 showed that adverse life events and early life stress also increase the risk of epilepsy. ## Can Post-traumatic Epilepsy Resolve Over Time?

In this connection, an earlier article in The Epilepsy Foundation says that about half of those developing PTE years after traumatic brain injury may experience spontaneous remission. This could be either permanent or temporary. ## Is It Possible to Prevent Post-traumatic Epilepsy? The World Health Organization (WHO) states that about 25 percent of epilepsy cases are preventable. To reduce the risk of post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE), the best approach is to protect the head from injuries by: * Minimizing the risk of falls. * Driving cautiously to avoid accidents. * Always wear a seatbelt when driving. * Using protective headgear at work to prevent occupational injuries. * Wearing proper head protection during sports to avoid head injuries. **Conclusion** : Post-traumatic epilepsy is a network of consequences of traumatic brain injury. It is often classified as a chronic seizure condition after any brain injury. People who experience traumatic brain injury have a high risk of developing seizures and epilepsy. Post-traumatic epilepsy can be a complex and large problem that should never be ignored. Post-traumatic epilepsy can be caused by various biomechanical processes that occur in the brain after any trauma. The prognosis of post-traumatic epilepsy is considered the worst.

The term photophobia was derived from two Greek words, photo meaning "light" and phobia meaning "fear," literally meaning "fear of light." Photophobia can develop due to various medical conditions, including central nervous system (CNS) disorders, primary eye conditions, and psychiatric disorders. Many developments have occurred since the original literature explained the manifestations of photophobia, making it possible to establish a more precise picture of photophobia. It is often associated with migraine headaches but can also occur in other conditions, such as meningitis (inflammation of the protective covering of the brain and the spinal cord), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), traumatic brain injury, and multiple sclerosis. ## What Is Photophobia? Photophobia is an abnormally high sensitivity to light. The sensitivity can cause eye or headaches or discomfort. Photophobia is a fairly common phobia. On its own, the incidence is usually not regarded as particularly medically serious. However, sensitivity can be personally debilitating and can interfere with daily life. Mild cases cause one to squint in a well-lit room or while outside. In more serious conditions, this condition causes significant

a fairly common phobia. On its own, the incidence is usually not regarded as particularly medically serious. However, sensitivity can be personally debilitating and can interfere with daily life. Mild cases cause one to squint in a well-lit room or while outside. In more serious conditions, this condition causes significant pain when the eyes are exposed to almost any type of light. The majority of people report that the lights are far too bright. They might also complain of pain or discomfort in or around their eyes. Other symptoms of photophobia include: * Sensitivity and aversion to normal light sources. * Noticing brightly colored spots. * Squinting. * Having trouble reading and experiencing forehead pain. * Tears in the eyes. * Having extremely dry eyes. * Feeling tired in the eyes and wanting to close the eyes. ## How Does Migraine Cause Photophobia? Migraines are a type of headache that is characterized by severe head ache on one side, along with other symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to sound and light. Photophobia is a common migraine symptom that can exacerbate the pain associated with migraines. The precise cause of photophobia in migraines is unknown; however, it is believed to be related to trigeminal nerve activation, which transmits pain signals from the head and face to the brain. When the trigeminal nerve is activated during a migraine attack, light sensitivity increases, causing discomfort and pain. The brainstem and thalamus, in addition to the trigeminal nerve, may play a role in

be related to trigeminal nerve activation, which transmits pain signals from the head and face to the brain. When the trigeminal nerve is activated during a migraine attack, light sensitivity increases, causing discomfort and pain. The brainstem and thalamus, in addition to the trigeminal nerve, may play a role in the development of photophobia in migraines. These brain regions are involved in sensory information processing, including visual information, and can become overactive during a migraine attack. **Treatment** : Photophobia in migraines may be treated with medications that target the underlying cause of the migraines, such as triptans, a class of drugs that work to reduce inflammation and constrict blood vessels in the brain. Other medications, such as beta-blockers or anticonvulsants, may also be used to treat photophobia symptoms. ## How Do Meningitis and Encephalitis Cause Photophobia? Meningitis and encephalitis are both serious infections that can affect the brain and spinal cord. These infections can inflame the meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, resulting in symptoms such as fever, headache, and photophobia. In these conditions, photophobia is thought to be caused by the irritation of the nerves that control the eyes, which can become inflamed as a result of the infection. The optic nerve (nerve which transmits visual information from the eye to the brain), may be affected by inflammation in some cases. **Treatment** : Treatment for photophobia in meningitis and encephalitis will typically involve treating the underlying infection with antibiotics or antiviral medications. In severe cases,

result of the infection. The optic nerve (nerve which transmits visual information from the eye to the brain), may be affected by inflammation in some cases. **Treatment** : Treatment for photophobia in meningitis and encephalitis will typically involve treating the underlying infection with antibiotics or antiviral medications. In severe cases, hospitalization may be needed to provide supportive care, such as IV (intravenous) fluids and medications to manage pain and inflammation. ## How Does Traumatic Brain Injury Cause Photophobia? Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a type of injury that occurs when the brain is exposed or subjected to a sudden impact, such as during a fall or a car accident. TBIs can cause a variety of cognitive and sensory symptoms, including photophobia, in addition to physical brain damage. Photophobia may be a sign of damage to the brain's visual processing centers in TBI. These brain regions are in charge of processing visual information, including light, and can be damaged as a result of the injury. In addition to the visual processing centers, the trigeminal nerve may be involved in the development of photophobia in TBI. When the trigeminal nerve is activated as a result of an injury, it can cause increased sensitivity to light, which can cause discomfort and pain. **Treatment** : Treatment for photophobia in TBI typically involves managing the underlying condition and reducing symptoms. This can include avoiding bright or flashing lights, wearing sunglasses or specialized lenses to reduce the amount of light entering the eyes, and using medications

sensitivity to light, which can cause discomfort and pain. **Treatment** : Treatment for photophobia in TBI typically involves managing the underlying condition and reducing symptoms. This can include avoiding bright or flashing lights, wearing sunglasses or specialized lenses to reduce the amount of light entering the eyes, and using medications such as beta- blockers or anticonvulsants to reduce sensitivity to light. ## How Does Multiple Sclerosis Cause Photophobia? Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the CNS, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. Photophobia is a common MS symptom that can be caused by a number of factors. Photophobia in MS may be caused by optic nerve damage or inflammation of the brain and spinal cord in some cases. This can cause changes in how the brain processes visual information, including increased sensitivity to light. Furthermore, MS can damage the myelin sheath, which surrounds nerve fibers present in the brain and spinal cord. This can alter the way signals are transmitted between nerve cells, affecting visual processing and contributing to the development of photophobia. **Treatment** : Photophobia treatment in multiple sclerosis entails managing the underlying condition as well as reducing symptoms. To reduce inflammation and immune response associated with MS, medications such as corticosteroids, interferons, and immunosuppressants can be prescribed, which can help reduce symptoms such as photophobia. Avoiding bright or flashing lights and using specialized lenses or filters to reduce the amount of light entering the eyes can also be beneficial. ## How

and immune response associated with MS, medications such as corticosteroids, interferons, and immunosuppressants can be prescribed, which can help reduce symptoms such as photophobia. Avoiding bright or flashing lights and using specialized lenses or filters to reduce the amount of light entering the eyes can also be beneficial. ## How Does Parkinson's Disease Cause Photophobia? Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that mainly affects the motor system, resulting in tremors, muscle stiffness, and difficulties with balance and coordination. Non-motor symptoms such as light sensitivity or photophobia may occur in some people with Parkinson's disease. The exact cause of photophobia in Parkinson's disease is unknown. It could, however, be linked to changes in the manner the brain processes visual information or changes in the structures of the eye. It could also be a side effect of Levodopa, a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease. **Treatment** : Treatment for photophobia in Parkinson's disease typically involves managing the underlying condition and reducing symptoms. Treatment for Parkinson's disease typically involves medications that help to manage the symptoms, such as Levodopa and dopamine agonists. In some cases, deep brain stimulation surgery may also be recommended. Additionally, physical therapy, speech therapy, dietary and lifestyle changes like improved physical activitymay also be recommended. ## How Does Epilepsy Cause Photophobia?

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures caused by abnormal electrical activity within the brain. Photophobia, or sensitivity to light, is a common symptom of epilepsy, especially in people who have seizures that originate in the occipital lobe, the part of the brain that regulates visual information. The exact cause of photophobia in epilepsy is unknown. It could, however, be linked to changes in the manner that the brain processes visual information or changes in the structures of the eye. It could also be caused by epilepsy medications. **Treatment** : Treatment for photophobia in epilepsy typically involves managing the underlying condition and reducing symptoms. Treatment for epilepsy typically involves medications to manage seizures, such as anticonvulsants. In some cases, surgery or other procedures may also be recommended. Additionally, lifestyle changes such as getting proper sleep, avoiding triggers, and avoiding alcohol and drugs may also be recommended. **Conclusion** Photophobia is a sensory disturbance caused by light sensitivity that has been linked to a variety of neurological conditions. Photophobia is caused by nerve inflammation, damage to the brain's visual processing centers, or damage to the optic nerve. Photophobia treatment entails managing the underlying condition as well as reducing symptoms. Depending on the underlying cause, various medications such as beta-blockers, anticonvulsants, or triptans may be used.
